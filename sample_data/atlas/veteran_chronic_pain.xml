Whatever needed to be stashed quick so the kids didn't monkey with, went into this big black hutch in our kitchen.  Something in my home didn't feel right.  It didn't flow.  In fact, visual clutter disturbs and agitates my husband, so that is why the quick tuck it away habit became routine.  I was starting to feel like my home was not reflecting our personality as a family, and it was beginning to wear on me.  It was no longer feeling like home, and here I am, now home full time, not understanding why.</p></content>
