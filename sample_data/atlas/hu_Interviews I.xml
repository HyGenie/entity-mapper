   <content size="1004"><p> the demands sort of go both ways its not so like you work in the studio and turn something up its like people collectors start to put more pressure on what's produced which seems closer to like what photography used to be like the photographer would shoot everything and then it would go into post and now its because its digital people stand there and the client is looking at whats been shot and directing so they dont like something they are seeing it immediately and then its been adjusted and its been adjusted and its been adjusted - which didn't used to be the case it used to be like the photographer was very much in control of that situation and then afterwards they would just give the final product and sometimes art seems a little bit more like that like not so direct but that there is a pressure that comes from what's dem/ what's / what's received well to like replicate that and to reproduce it which I see as somehow similar to that relationship with the photographer and client</p></content>

   <comment type="text/html" size="474"><p>Collectors only buy art when they can recognize certain qualities for value - a white, big gallery space; a certain neighborhood; certain digital representations. Lucas says here at this point, that this is a collector's demand and a reason why the gallery space will not disappear. It is somehow an established demand. If we relate this to Barthes language of fashion, these demands are certain signs the collector recognizes, that is the knowledge a collector accumulates.</p></comment>
