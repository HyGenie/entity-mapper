Like I said, you know what, I'm not sure about this (Q: mm hmm) and it was something like, I just had a funny feeling, and I went in there and maybe I was a little intimidated because there was not only my genetics counselor but Dr.&lt;incomprehensible&gt; and another surgeon I think (Q: mm hmm) and maybe someone doing an internship. There were a lot of people and then, and I got a little emotional. I was just like, ah, what a bummer. But, I mean, I have the information now. It's ok. It's gonna, I mean, at least I know, and now I can take, I can get tested every so often (Q: mm hmm) and do what I need to do so-- </p></content>

   <content size="532"><p>A: And then that to me wasn't, I still wasn't, I worried every single day (Q: mm hmm) so I swore to myself that, you know, if I were ever blessed to get pregnant again I would do one of these tests (Q: mm hmm) so we did do the CVS (Q: uh huh) just cause I wanted to find out earlier and everything else. Everyone has their reasons why, you know, whether to test or now, or whether, for me I didn't want to wait (Q: mm hmm) until week 18 to get tested.

<p>Q: What was that like for you?</p>
<p>A: I have to say I haven't thought, worried, nearly (Q: mm hmm) half as much as I did the first time around. Um, which might be good and bad because thought, I've been a little more laid back this pregnancy but maybe that's also a second, a second pregnancy, um, but it was yeah, it was a big relief, and a big relief to have it, that test, as opposed to the amniocentesis, having you know, having it so early, so God forbid there is something wrong, you know, you can make your choice, um, decision (Q: mm hmm) then before you're telling the whole world (Q: mm hmm) that you know you're pregnant. </p>
<p>Q: Yeah </p>

   <content size="578"><p>A: Exactly, exactly. Yeah the things that I, like I chose to have a CVS test. My one sister was you know, she was like, well why? Why? What would that do? And she, it becomes a really personal decision (Q: Mm hmm, yeah) because her, you know, we're different in those things (Q: mm hmm) you know, I don't, I don’t, you know, it took her a long time to get pregnant (Q: mm hmm) and I think she would have had, you know, whatever happened to her children happen, and she would have these kids no matter what (Q: mm hmm).

   <content size="899"><p>Q: All that, yeah, (A: Yeah) obviously I was thinking about you and wondering if this was familiar (A: Yeah) as you were doing it. What had you heard about preimplantation genetic diagnosis for BRCA before today?</p>
<p>A: Actually I, the only thing when I got tested at Sloan Kettering through Dr. Robson, Mark Robson, um, or I would have a scan or you know whatever I would go in for my 3 to 6 months appointment, he mentioned something like, it was very much, very in passing, like, well, there's, should you want to find out more information you could. There's a possibility they could extract the cells from you know, your, from the fetus or whatever at that point so you don't have to pass this gene a long and I just thought, oh wow, that's so, that's beyond what I imagined that we could do today. (Q: mm hmm) I don't know, what do I know. So, um, it didn't resonate with me though. </p></content>

<p>A: Yeah, it's very clear, yeah it comes across very, you know, everything that it brings back my genetics counseling session, all the information in there and a lot of new information but it's presented very clearly.</p></content>

   <content size="1286"><p>Q: Yeah (A: laughs) Um, uh actually I may jump ahead to some of the questions about prenatal diagnosis, um, because uh, because of that issue. Um, would you have uh, you know were it available would you have considered prenatal diagnosis? Like I said it's not available but for um (A: oh no &lt;incomprehensible&gt;) for BRCA, if you could. like I said it's not really available, but </p>
<p>A: Sure. I mean, yeah, then I wonder like what would I do with that information (Q: mm hmm) um I don't know. Like I said before I just, the idea for me to like extract something (Q: mm hmm) and get so medically involved, it's a little big brotherish (Q: mm hmm) so, it'd be good to know. Better to know now than never know or (Q: mm hmm). um, i don't think it would have changed my (Q: mm hmm) my views still on, you know for the extraction </p>
<p>Q: mm hmm yeah, and &lt;blank spot in recording&gt; take out, take out that gene &lt;incomprehensible&gt; </p>
<p>A: Oh, oh okay</p>
<p>Q: And then they test, they take out one of the 8 cells and then they test it before (A: ahhh) And then uh, they're removing a cell from the embryo, they're not removing the gene. They only the transfer what embryos that don't have it but there's something being removed. (A: Yeah) Um, yeah mm hmm </p></content>

   <content size="737"><p>Q: And have you heard anything about prenatal diagnosis for BRCA before this presentation?</p>
<p>A: No, if it was offered in that whole bunch of what, CVS tests or an amnio, that would be really, I would find that very interesting. Would it change my decision to extract that gene (Q: mm hmm) knowing that I have it and I'm a carrier? Probably not. </p>
<p>Q: Mm hmm, yeah and I'll actually in a bit ask (A: Yeah) you more questions about that </p>
<p>A: But I, yeah, cause, it's interesting. (Q: mm hmm) yeah</p>
<p>Q: Yeah</p>
<p>A: I don't even know exactly everything that's tested for in those, I said I wanted to be tested for everything, (laughs) so </p>

   <content size="3173"><p>Q: Yeah, um, and like I said, these are, these are hypothetical (A: yeah) questions and, you know, and difficult abstract questions (A: Yeah) not just difficult questions, um, and uh, so uh, so I asked you about, um, what, um, well one of the questions we wanted to ask was about um, how, how information about PGD should be presented to patients. Um, like you said it's starting to sort of trickle down so somebody may mention it in passing whether in genetic counseling or you know, an oncologist, um, an an OB/GYN, but do you have any opinions um, how, if at all, genetic counselors should talk with their patients about the option of PGD?</p>
<p>A: Um, yeah it's tricky. I wonder if, um, I mean I remember my first, uh, doctor. I transferred, I ended up transferring um OB/GYNS but at first, and she would, she sat across from me and showed me all these lists of different, and the pros and the cons and the timeline of when all these things need to happen. (Q: mm hmm) And I think I was newly, I mean I was really newly pregnant I was maybe (Q: Yeah) 8 weeks or 6 or, it made me to have to happen, I mean I was &lt;incomprehensible&gt; if you're doing CVS (Q: mm hmm) and you wanna know um or, actually, back up, I guess</p>
<p>Q: So for PGD you'd actually </p>
<p>A: Yeah you'd want to know (Q: mm hmm) beforehand so, um, I guess hopefully your doctor knows your history or asks you about family history and it's something that's just brought about in a routine checkup or if they say like, you know, my husband and I are trying to start a family </p>
<p>Q: Mm hmm yeah, do you think it should be part of routine, um, uh, BRCA, bracka counseling or wait until somebody expresses that we're thinking about having kids, you know, I'm thinking about having kids kind of thing and then um, and then bring it up. Is it, do you think it would be too much to present in, um... </p>
<p>A: In a BRCA</p>
<p>Q: Yeah, mm hmm</p>
<p>A: No, I think the more is better</p>

I mean to put it out there and just say I don't know if this is right for you but know it's an option? (Q: mm hmm yeah) Absolutely.</p>
<p>Q: Yeah so then people who are interested, at least the seed would be planted (A: Exactly) and they can pursue it</p>

   <content size="1578"><p>A: My mom had cancer in her 30s, probably my age, she was between like 36 to 38 years old, and she always thought it was due to maybe some fertility she took back in the 60s, she needed fertility for my two older sisters, and then, and she got it so early, so young, um, and had a hysterectomy, and that's been that. What prompted me to get tested were three cousins on my dad's side that, well it was one of the first and they're all around age 40 (Q: mm hmm), 43. They got tested and had surgery, and two of the three. The third daughter, like, she tested positive but she doesn't know what She's going to do with the information yet. </p>
<p>Q: Did they have cancer or were their surgeries preventative? </p>
<p>A: Preventative. No, I take that back. They both had cancer and they both had the gene, and it happened really, like, back to back. The third daughter, she doesn't know what she's going to do. Um, so I just thought, I have this information, why not test for that specific gene? Um, and I did and it was negative, but they kept some of my um blood on file just because my family's history is a little interesting, so they said you know we'd really like to get your parents in here, test them, we'll see and then from that information you and your sisters, you know, might not need to be tested at all any more or we'll know exactly what we're looking for, and so Mom and Dad came in and Dad's negative which cuts off that whole gene that my cousins have but interestingly, mom turned up positive for BRCA2, and then they tested me again and I was positive</p></content>

<p>Q:	Oh, the cervical cancer vaccine?</p>
<p>A:	Yes, that’s it.  So I’ll be sure in the next couple years she gets that.  Because that’s important.</p>
<p>Q:	Is that something you’ve talked with your wife about?</p>
<p>A:	Briefly but not fully.</p>
<p>Q:	Okay, is she on the same page?  Does she agree?</p>
<p>A:	I think so, yes.</p>
<p>Q:	But your thinking is more about cancer, it’s about cancer prevention for the vaccine.  </p>

   <content size="1756"><p>Q:	Okay.  Have your thoughts about being a carrier changed over time as your kids have gotten older or as your stepfather’s gotten ill?  Or as other things have changed in your life?  Or has it been pretty constant?</p>
<p>A:	It’s been pretty constant.</p>
<p>Q:	Are there times when you feel more concerned or worried or maybe something going on, than other times?</p>
<p>A:	Well, it’s the type of thing that if you get sick or your head’s hurting you or your arm’s hurting you or whatever, the first thought now is always cancer.  But then you try to be rational and make sure, you know, that you’re probably overreacting, while there was maybe a time where there wasn’t an overreaction.  </p>
<p>Q:	So you find that you’re wanting to think these things out with your physician when you’re feeling these aches and pains?</p>
<p>A:	Well, it depends on what degree.  But yeah, I’m more apt to see a doctor.</p>
<p>Q:	Okay, that has a been a very, very common experience, that people feel an ache here, it’s cancer, a headache, it’s a brain tumor.  That’s a very common-</p>
<p>A:	I get migraine headaches and I’ve just always had bad headaches.  The past year it got worse and I now see a migraine doctor, but the first few months with that, recently, it was ‘Do I have a brain tumor?’  I did go for the MRIs and everything else.  </p>
<p>Q:	Absolutely.  How was your stress level during that?  Was it, so you think, “Yes, oh my gosh, maybe it’s a brain tumor.”  How invested were you in that?</p>
<p>A:	It depends on the moment.  If you lie in bed early in the morning and your head’s hurting you, then you’re thinking that.  But during the day when you’re busy, you just don’t think about it.</p></content>

But from what I know about the BRCA genetic test is: even with positive testing it does not mean you’ll get cancer, it just means you’re an increased risk.  It’s still a low percentage.  It just means you need to be careful, do more testing, do more screening and the early screening, I thought, was in the 30s or 40s, I forget exactly.  So I’m trying to figure out what’s the benefit of doing some of the testing.  I guess it depends on what the person’s going to do with that information.  </p></content>

<p>A:	Probably closest with my stepfather in that we were definitely not a caretaker but we would see him every week or two, go visit him.  The last three months he stayed in hospice.  So we tried to visit there often as well.  Watching him, watching the end, that was hard.  And you can tell when it’s close to the end.  </p></content>

<p>A:	Well, usually but I believe that things you can’t control, you can’t stress or worry about, because what you can control is what you should focus on.  And that’s why, like now, I need to go for the colon screening now before I forget, because that’s something I could do, could control right now.  Whether she has the gene or not, yeah, it’s very worrisome in terms of her life [ph], but there’s nothing I can do about it, there’s nothing she can do about it for a long time, even if we knew.

   <content size="2467"><p>Q:	Do you have any experience with, if not personally, with people close to you, people you know having gone through IVF or other assisted reproductive technologies?</p>
<p>A:	I know-well, my mother-in-law used fertility medicines for a long time with Adam, my husband.  A couple of my coworkers, actually their wives have gone through IVF successfully and had babies-multiples, actually.  Well, not hugely successful, but-but, so I know a couple of, you know, coworker’s wives that have gone through IVF.  </p>
<p>Q:	When you say not hugely successful, not everybody got pregnant, or-bad outcomes?  </p>
<p>A:	Well, it took a while, with my boss’s wife, she did end up getting pregnant with twins, and the one twin never fully developed.  They were both born-both born alive, and one of the twins just, he was just a mess.  His digestive system never fully developed, and all these problems, and he was in the hospital for a full year and then he finally died.  So-but then, the weirdest thing is they-so they had the one son, and a couple of years later she just got pregnant naturally.  </p>
<p>Q:	Wow.  </p>
<p>A:	And then I have another coworker who did the IVF.  I think they had to do it a couple of times as well, and she was successful at twins also.  </p>
<p>Q:	Okay.</p>
<p>A:	So-</p>
<p>Q:	So they had better outcomes-</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, healthy-yeah.  Healthy.  I mean I don’t know if it was the IVF that caused that-you know, who knows.  I don’t think you can really, as far as I know-obviously I’m not that personal with him, so-</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.</p>
<p>A:	It could’ve been a variety of other things that caused that, so-</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  I mean one of the risks with twins-and triplets and higher-is that, you know, they may not-the resources might not be distributed equally.  </p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah, so that just happens.  </p>
<p>A:	Yeah.</p>
<p>Q:	It could happen-doesn’t always happen.  </p>
<p>		So, did you hear much about that when they were going through it, or just that they were-?</p>
<p>A:	No, nothing too personal.  Obviously, you know, I have the relationship with the man, so they’re not gonna really get into detail [laughs].</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.</p>
<p>A:	I do remember my boss telling me that it was really painful.  That’s all I remember about it.</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  Yeah, certainly it’s quite, it’s not an easy thing, from what I hear.  </p>

<p>Q:	Do you have any close experience with that, people that you know who’ve had testing?  </p>
<p>A:	No-</p>
<p>Q:	If they’ve gotten negative amnio-sort of bad news results?  </p>
<p>A:	No.  My boss’s wife when she was pregnant with the twins, she got the amnio I remember.  That’s when they found out, you know, that something was wrong with one of the twins.</p>
<p>Q:	Oh wow, so they knew.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, they knew.  And my-one of my best girlfriends is pregnant right now and they offered her the amnio but she declined it because, I guess because she was scared of the risks involved.  I guess some of her blood levels were elevated, so they posed it to her, but because of the risk she said no, she didn’t want to do it.  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  </p>

   <content size="2355"><p>Q:	All right.  So what were you thinking about?  I mean you sort of mentioned this, but during the presentation did you have any specific thoughts about them, or just sort of-</p>
<p>A:	It kind of made me feel a little uneasy to the first one, the in vitro one.  I don’t know that I would go through all that to do it, to be honest with you.  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.</p>
<p>A:	To stop it.  So, I guess I was feeling like I don’t know if that would be worth it, like to go through all of that and the expense and everything.  You know, what I’ve heard before through my, the genetics people, which, you know, was five years ago, I do remember them saying, you know, check your children at 18.  That’s usually what they recommend, right?  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah, certainly they don’t recommend before then.</p>
<p>A:	Right, right.  So, I don’t know, I guess-are you asking me if I agree with it or don’t agree with it?  </p>
<p>Q:	Well, you know what, later on I’ll ask you a little bit more-</p>
<p>A:	Okay. [laughs]</p>
<p>Q:	So you don’t even have to-you can think about it and-</p>
<p>A:	Right-</p>
<p>Q:	You know, and there’s the do I agree with it for myself, do I agree with it for other people, to sort of unpack all of that.</p>
<p>A:	Right.  </p>
<p>Q:	You said that you felt that way about PGD.  Did you have any different feelings, just sort of initial reactions-like I said, I’ll ask you some more detailed questions later-about prenatal diagnosis?  Did that seem different or-</p>
<p>A:	I have heard of that before, so I don’t know if maybe I’m just more easy with that because I know it’s a thing that women do.  I don’t know a lot about it, but I do know that amnio is a little dangerous too.  So-and just that whole thing-I guess I’m pretty open-minded when it comes to, like women, they can choose what they want to do.  But I don’t know that I would choose to do that, you know, like to-because when it comes-you know, if you find out you have something wrong with your baby, oh gosh, I don’t know if I could make that decision to terminate or do something, you know, to change that.  So it’s like, all right, if you find out that information what would you do with it?  I guess that’s what I would kind of think about first, what would I do with it if it was worst case scenario, you know?  </p></content>

   <content size="1199"><p>A:	At that time I don’t think I would have done anything with that information.  I don’t know.  I mean I guess women might want to hear about that if they’re currently pregnant or, you know, about to be pregnant or something like that.  I guess I would want to be presented with any information possible, but then make sure that I’m educated about it enough to make a decision.  Because I mean at that time you’re kind of just worried about yourself, and you might not be thinking-at least, I was only 24.  I didn’t have any kids.  You know, if a mom walked in there, or if a pregnant woman walked in there it might be different.  You know, it might be something that they think about.  But I think you also have to worry about people’s mental states at that point too, because a lot of the time, you know, they are just diagnosed or, you know, or a sister was just diagnosed or something, so I feel like people are a lot more emotional and maybe not as logical in their decision making. [laughs] You know, so I think that’s also something that I think I would want to know but definitely I would have to be-make sure that the message of it is, you know, real clear about it. </p></content>

   <content size="1126"><p>A:	I don’t know, maybe as like a follow up session, because at that point, I mean that appointment is a couple hours long, and it is information overload, even just with what they give you.  So maybe upon positive diagnosis you have a follow up appointment to talk about your results and then also present other options that are available to you.  So maybe not at that-because what would be the point of telling someone this, you know, during the genetic counseling session when you don’t even know if you’re positive or negative yet?  </p>
<p>Q:	So not when you’re deciding about whether to get tested and learning about testing-</p>
<p>A:	Right.</p>
<p>Q:	But maybe if you test positive-</p>
<p>A:	Because at that point, you know, you’re already learning that you could pass it to your child, if you have it or not, so that’s already, you know, being voiced to these people.  So I would think maybe in a separate session, like, okay, you’re positive.  What does this mean for you, what does this mean for your children-or your future children, you know, what you could do.  These are your options.  </p></content>

   <content size="435"><p>Yeah.  But I would say-yeah, you know, I would say-I guess you would have to ask yourself, like does everyone need to know about that at that time?

   <content size="668"><p>A:	Yeah, just so much information.

That’s all I cared about.</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  Like, “Answer me these three questions and we’re good for now.” [laughs]</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  Right, exactly.  And then, you know, once I figured that out and was able to process everything and do everything else I was doing at that time, which was everything, you know, then your mind can kind of, you know, be open for more information.  </p></content>

But I think you have to present them obviously with all the information about the gene, the positives and negatives of getting tested.

<p>A:	I was the first one, yes.  So then I took that information and-my mom has one sister and two brothers, and they were very far apart in age.  And, you know, we didn’t really keep contact with them either.  We kept contact with one of the brothers, and I sent the information to him and I said that, “You should really get tested,” because he has a son, my cousin, and then my cousin has kids.  </p>
<p>		So, then my mother’s sister was 16 years older than her, so I was able to contact her and give her the information as well, because she had four daughters.  And so to this day the sister never did anything with the information, and her daughters have had no cancer.  </p>
<p>Q:	Do her daughters know, your cousins know about your testing?  </p>
<p>A:	I believe so, yes.  I mean, again, like I don’t keep contact with them, but the brother that we do keep in contact with, he ended up getting tested, because my cousin, who’s a male, wanted to get tested for his kids, and they said, “Well, you should send your dad in first.”  So he got tested, my uncle got tested and he did not have it, so that was good.  </p></content>

So I had all them, and I mean they were great.  At the time my sister was eight months pregnant, at the time that I was diagnosed, so-and like I said, she’s the worrywart of the family and [laughs] so I wasn’t sure, and my dad, you know, he tries to protect us, his two girls, so he contacted her doctor and he’s like-he was scared that she was gonna go into labor or something-</p>
<p>Q:	[laughs] “Should we even tell her,” yeah-</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  So that was kind of stressful for me because I wanted to tell her, and my dad told me not to.  But I had my husband, who was fantastic during the whole thing.  And my dad was great too.  He would drive me in for appointments here, so-and then I did tell my sister a couple of weeks after.  But I kind of like downplayed it initially.  </p>

<p>Q:	Did you-just through searching-</p>
<p>A:	I don’t know, I guess, yeah, through searching and-I don’t know.  I probably, once I found out about the BRCA I probably was just Googling that more, and I found their website.  And it was fantastic.  Their message boards were like my saving grace, and I was obsessed with being on them and asking women questions, and I just thought it was fantastic.  </p>
<p>		And then through one of my posts, I had a question, someone said-you know, because I think I said, you know, “I’m 24, just diagnosed, what do I do,” you know, something to that effect.  And someone did refer me to that young survival coalition, but I went onto their website, but I found that the FORCE website was very responsive.  I would type a question that I had and I would get, you know, 20 answers.  And then there was a group of women in New Jersey that met, so I met at their house; they were great.  And now that I’ve moved to Charlotte I actually started volunteering with Komen, and for the past two years I’ve just gotten more involved and now I’m their PR chair for their race and I’m just super involved with them down there.  </p>
<p>		But, you know, as far as like a support group, that was my first thing that I went to, that FORCE website, yeah.  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah, and actually had an opportunity to meet people through that, which is-that’s really great.  </p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  </p>
<p>Q:	And I was going to ask you something-oh, did you-</p>
<p>A:	Oh, and I went to that conference.  It was in Philadelphia, young survival-I guess maybe it was their conference.  I forget who put it on.</p>
<p>Q:	Oh, was this like a few years ago too?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, so this must have been in 2004.  It was in Philadelphia-</p>
<p>Q:	I think they’re doing another one in Toronto this year, is that the same-</p>
<p>A:	Okay, yeah-I don’t-I can’t remember who put it on.  But it was for young survivors specifically.  </p>
<p>Q:	Okay.  Great.  So you did, you were able to connect with other people.  </p>
<p>A:	Yeah.</p>
<p>Q:	Did that make a difference?  </p>
<p>A:	It did, because everything I was finding was for women who were older, so, like a lot of the information I found, it didn’t really pertain to me at all, and I just-you know, even then though there weren’t many 20-somethings.  And then I-I didn’t go onto the website for several years.  Kind of, you know, life gets in the way again.  I guess that’s a good thing.  But I revisited it probably about a year ago, and I just saw so many posts and women saying that they were in their twenties.  And I don’t know if it’s just because people are more educated about it now or getting the testing, but even more-you know, what was that, like a three or four year span when I couldn’t find maybe but one or two online, and there were several posts with 20-somethings.  </p></content>

<p>Q:	Yeah.  There’s a difference-yeah, lifetime is different if you’re at different ages.  </p>

<p>Q:	Yeah.  Does that affect your views about it, or-?</p>
<p>A:	No, I think if I really wanted a baby and I couldn’t any way else I think I would-if I had the money, if I had the resources at the time then I probably would do it.  </p>
<p>Q:	One of the things that it does obviously bring up is that some people could do it and some people couldn’t do it.</p>
<p>A:	True, yeah.</p>
<p>Q:	Is that-you know, for some people that’s a big concern and for some people that’s not.  </p>
<p>A:	Right.  </p>
<p>Q:	I guess what’s your reaction to that issue?</p>
<p>A:	So, like it not being fair you mean?</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah, I mean it’s certainly a means that some people would potentially be able to access-</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  I mean I guess that’s, yeah, kind of a sad thing.  If a woman really, really wants to have a baby and she’s not as rich as this other woman who wants a baby and the richer woman could do it, that doesn’t seem fair to me.  </p></content>

I don’t think I’d want my child to know that they’re carrying around this gene and that they might get cancer, you know-obviously I’d keep the results secret or something.  But I think that I’d probably wait until they were 18 and, you know, could really understand the information and just get the simple blood test at that point.  And then you have 18 years for, you know, some medical history to be made.  So I think if I found out that it was BRCA positive what would that do?  You know, what would I do with that information?

<p>Q:	Yeah.  </p>
<p>A:	So I’m the first one that survived from it, and I really think it was because of, you know, the gynecologist telling me to go get that baseline at 25.  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.</p>
<p>A:	Because if I would’ve waited, you know, who knows what would’ve happened.  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  So it really, yeah, it felt like a certainty, “Look at my history”-</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  Definitely.  Definitely.  I mean just, you know, everyone died.  And I just, you know, remember what my mom went through, and I just, I didn’t want to go through that, you know?  </p></content>

   <content size="653"><p> So, then just growing up one of my gynecologists actually told me that I should get a baseline mammogram at age 25, or 10 years prior to my mom’s diagnosis, which was still 25.  So I had just gone to my gynecologist, everything was fine, and I went to get the mammogram, not thinking anything of it, and they said they found what they thought was micro calcifications, so they did another mammogram, and then it was clustered, so then they did the needle biopsy and found out that it was DCIS.  So basically, you know, the breast cancer’s still in the duct and it hadn’t spread yet, so I guess it’s the best kind of cancer you can get.  </p></content>

<p>A:	Yeah, I do.  I definitely do.  And I even said to my doctor today, because she asked me about, you know, family planning.  I said, you know, “When I get pregnant is that something I have to really be concerned with, because of, you know, the flush of hormones in your body and everything?”  And she kind of walked me through it, so-you know, that’s the reason why I had to stop taking the pill, the birth control pill, because it was adding extra estrogen.  So I would definitely be a little concerned with that, of getting those extra hormones in your body.  I guess I would have to find out, you know, what to look for or what the risks are for that causing a recurrence.  You know, obviously I had a bilateral mastectomy and-but, you know, there’s always some stuff left over.  So it’s not 100%.

You know, and I actually felt sort of like-I wasn’t so sure I wanted to do it.  I felt sort of pushed into it by other members of my family.

<p>Q:	Exactly.  So, now-I know you said this off the audio; I’ll say it on the audio, just so we have it.  So, you were undergoing PGD for other reasons, you said for-</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, we were carriers of spinal muscular atrophy, which is a devastating disease.  So we were undergoing PGD for that reason.  </p>

<p>A:	It was a lot of shots, a lot of hormones.  It was really-I mean it’s kind of a blur now, but it was tough.</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  Did you feel like, as you were doing it did you say-did you question it, because of when you were doing it, that it was the right-</p>
<p>A:	I never questioned it.  My husband has two cousins who are afflicted with spinal muscular atrophy, and I saw that, what they went through, and I never questioned why I was doing it.  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  </p>
<p>A:	That was not ever-</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  Actually, I have a friend who  went through IVF, and she was saying, “It was very hard when I was doing it, and it’s a total blur,” and she has two kids, and she goes, “And now I forget it.”</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  It was worth it.  It was worth it, you know? [laughs] You know, I remember carrying syringes around in my purse at, like weddings. </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  So, was it-emotionally was that-as a psychologist I’m interested in this, those aspects, because I know IVF treatment can be a lot-</p>
<p>A:	You know what the problem is?  You’re so affected by the hormones-I don’t know whether I was actually emotionally affected, or just the drugs were making me-and I’m pretty matter of fact and laid back, so it doesn’t really, but there were days when I would just lose it, crying-</p>
<p>Q:	Wow, yeah.  I’ve heard that, that it’s just really-</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, the drugs are tough.  </p>
<p>Q:	The hormones are really-</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  </p>
<p>Q:	Did you have any concerns about taking hormones then, given-</p>
<p>A:	With the-</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah, and how was that talked about?  </p>
<p>A:	You know, I spoke to my surgeon at Sloan Kettering about it, and she really didn’t think it was an issue.  You know, I did a lot of reading on it, and the studies that I’ve seen, they seemed to show that there’s not a problem.  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.</p>
<p>A:	So, you know-</p>
<p>Q:	And that’s certainly what we’ve been reassured.  </p>
<p>A:	Right.  I knew-I spoke to the doctors at Cornell as well, and they also feel that at this point they don’t think there’s any issue.  But, you know, they don’t really have complete information yet is my understanding.  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  So it was a concern, but a concern you were willing to-</p>
<p>A:	Right.  </p>
<p>Q:	Whatever unknown risks there could or could not be, you were willing to take them for this.  </p>
<p>		So, you said that you ended up doing the PGD for both.  But you said that there ended up, the embryos were all BRCA positive, was that-?</p>
<p>A:	I think what happened was-I’m going to try and remember the numbers.  They got-10 mature eggs, seven fertilized-yeah.  Five were healthy with no SMA.  Four out of the five were positive for BRCA.  So at the end of the day with the first round, the two best ones were positive for the BRCA, and we just put them in.  We just used those.  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  </p>
<p>A:	Now, ultimately I got pregnant off the second, the frozen, so I don’t really know if my daughter is positive for it or not.  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  </p>
<p>A:	She may not be.  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  Does that-that almost seems like a blessing in a way, that-</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  </p>
<p>Q:	That maybe that’s my take to not know-</p>

So it was sort of-you know, either I’m not going to nurse and get mammograms, or I’m going to nurse and reduce my risk.  So-and, you know, the screening is fine.

<p>A:	I also have a genetic marker for Cowden Syndrome, which puts me at a lot higher risk than most people.  Like, so I’m at a higher risk for breast and uterine cancer, and thyroid issues-like, my issues stem beyond just the BRCA, so a lot of my medical behavior, which I still, you know, I’ve dealt with the breasts, I’ve had a mastectomy a while ago, when I was 18.  Like, I dealt with that, but a lot of my health behaviors, it does-it stems from I want to have kids some day, and so my parents have talked about it with me. </p></content>

Like, I-I don’t know.  The women in my family are very fertile, so-like, I don’t-I see IVF for people who struggle.  And maybe that’s what bothers me about it.  It’s for people who struggle, and-I don’t want to say weak, because that sounds condescending, but, like who are having difficulty, and-even though I was, like, somebody who was having difficulty and overcoming health issues and everything, I still like to view myself as a strong, confident person, and, like, I just view it as, like I’m not able to accomplish my goals.

<p>A:	Like, I’ve read up on it, that you can get, like tested, you can have your whole genome sequenced for, like 160 different things.  Like, you just start getting really paranoid about it.

   <content size="1477"><p>Q:	So, how if at all do you think genetic counselors should talk with patients about the option of PGD?  Do you think they should mention it to people when they’re getting-especially people of reproductive age are getting genetic testing?  </p>
<p>A:	I think I should be careful.  Like, I mean MSK beyond amazing with everything.  Everything has been-everyone’s so nice.  I mean-I was told when I first got genetic-they were like, “You need to  consider having kids earlier.  You’re going to have to get”-you can be overwhelmed.  Like, for most women who-most women want to have children, whether they know it or not.  That’s my theory, at least.  Or it’s a concern, or they consider it.  When you have somebody telling you, “You’re going to need your ovaries removed”-like, it can be a little overwhelming.  Like, I almost wish that I went in, I got the basic information, I got to go home, digest, and then you come back in and you ask your questions.  It’s too much.  </p>
<p>Q:	You kind of get it in pieces.  </p>
<p>A:	You get it in pieces.  I was like, just crying, like-the woman was really nice, but she was kind of obnoxious at the same time, because she was like, “You have to get…”-because she was treating me like I was a 30-something year-old woman who was doing this and not an 18-year-old.  So maybe it’s different for other people, but for me at the age that I was it wasn’t the most glorifying experience.  But-yeah.  </p></content>

   <content size="1633"><p>Like, I think there needs to be a certain consideration of age.  Like, if I was-you know, even when I was 18, or when I’m 21, it’s still a high priority for me.  But, you know, everybody’s different, and I think there needs to be some consideration of age.  Like, when you’re telling me I’m already going to have to get my breasts removed and then you’re telling me I should get my, like uterus and ovaries removed-like, slow down.  Like, I’m 18.  Like, it’s the best I can articulate it.  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah, like I don’t need to be thinking about artificial reproductive technologies too-</p>
<p>A:	Well, it’s like you’re telling me all this information, it’s upsetting, it’s not always fun.  It’s not like something-you know, it’s something I could easily digest now.  When I first found out I’m like, all right, like, great.  </p>
<p>		But, I almost wish there was two sessions.  Because I got one session, you know, they’re telling me all these things, telling me, like you have to be off birth control, like, all this stuff.  Like, that definitely puts-put a damper on everything then.  Because I was in this whole new phase of my life.  Like, it was like emerging adulthood, like, I was away from my parents.  And they’re telling me all this stuff that kind of says, “You’re not in that.  You can’t do this.”  And it’s like there needs to be consideration of age-type of school, like, are they working-like, environment needs to be taken into consideration.  </p>

   <content size="3345"><p>Q:	So, it sounds like ideally this would be-you know, they should take into account, you know, where you’re at in life, developmentally, all these sorts of things.  Do you think it should come from the genetic counselor?  Do you think it should come from an ob/gyn?  Do you-would you care who it came from?  </p>
<p>A:	Well, I think it would have to be kept within the program.  Like, my ob/gyn, I don’t even know if there’s ob/gyns within MSK.  Like, I go to one outside of the program.  </p>
<p>		I think there needs to be more-I don’t want to say sympathy, because that’s the one thing I hate more than anything.  But it just needs to be-</p>
<p>Q:	Sensitivity-</p>
<p>A:	Sensitivity to it.  And most of the time, like everybody’s so sensitive, so nice.  Like, I never meet anybody who’s horrible.  Except maybe Dr. Cordeiro-but, he’s the best.  So, it’s forgiven.  </p>
<p>		But, like when you’re first getting that information and you get a plethora of, like all this information, you kind of just sit there and you’re like-like you need to have time to digest, kind of have a little-it’s my favorite theory in psychology-kind of have a little cognitive dissonance where you can calm yourself down, think more rationally about it.  Because you’re just stirring up all these emotions, and it doesn’t work all the time, so-</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah-</p>
<p>A:	I don’t know.  Maybe if it was from a different source, but-you know, I came in, there’s a doctor, then like a nurse/counselor kind of person.  He told me all this information, spit it out really kind of harshly, left the room and then I was left with her, and I’m just sitting there with my parents, who are all grouchy, and like upset too, and-I don’t know.  Maybe it’s-I have no idea.  I’ve already gone through this, so-</p>
<p>Q:	It sounds like for you it wouldn’t have been the right thing to hear at that time.  </p>
<p>A:	The way it was said.  It’s not a fact that-</p>
<p>Q:	Was it said?  Did they mention PGD-</p>
<p>A:	They didn’t mention PGD, but like the fact that I’m going to need to have kids earlier-like, stuff that’s partnered into it.  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  </p>
<p>A:	Like, I need to have kids earlier, I’m going to need my ovaries removed, I’m going to need my breasts removed, I probably am going to need my thyroid removed-all this within like a 40-minute period.  Like, it’s a lot to digest, and especially at 18, where I’m like emotionally fragile and-</p>
<p>Q:	You’re already-</p>
<p>A:	-a complete narcissist, and you’re like taking away every body part I have.  Like, cut off a leg while you’re at it.  Like, you know, it’s just a little-</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  So, yeah, so you’re saying it’s not even just about PGD, but just like how much information in general, especially about-you know, for a young person to hear, you know:  and have your kids early, and have this removed and have that removed.  It can just be really overwhelming.  </p>
<p>A:	It’s just funny, it’s like-and it definitely has impacted me.  I’m already-like, I already think about having kids.  I know it’s weird.  And most of my friends think it’s a little strange at my age, but I mean I’m prone to it because I know I have to.  But if it was laid on me a little nicer, that’d be great.  </p></content>

He respected me for doing everything I did, and he admired me, but we never-we never got to that point.  Like, you know, I knew that if it ever got serious-which, it ended up not on that level, like  having kids someday-like, it would have to be a discussion.  And I don’t like thinking about it, because I feel like some people might not react well to it.  I actually had a boyfriend when I was going through the whole mastectomy process, and it was nice because we were like long distance, but he like completely, he was my crutch through the whole thing.  And he was fine with it.  But as far as childbearing goes, the idea, I think if I said, like, “Let’s talk about when we have kids some day,” it would not fly with any of them.

<p>Q:	Yeah.  I’m sort of going to plant something I guess, just because it hasn’t come up.  Does it-you know, usually I wouldn’t sort of put an attitude out there and ask about your views, but would it bother you that some people would be able to afford it and some people wouldn’t?  So, some people could pay that $60,000 whereas others couldn’t-or, does that not, you know-does that feel-</p>
<p>A:	That doesn’t bother me.  </p>
<p>Q:	That’s not your big issue with it?</p>
<p>A:	It’s not my big issue.  I have some strange political views on it.  If you can’t produce kids and you can’t-you know, I just-yeah, it doesn’t bother me.  It’s like, you know, if you can’t produce a child, that’s fine.  You know, there’s other ways around it.  If you can afford to do IVF and it works, good for you, but, like-this is such a horrible theory, but I kind of have to agree with it.  Like, somebody said to me, they were like, “We keep getting stupider as a population,” because it’s the smart people who aren’t pushing breeding more, like having more kids.  It’s the stupid people who are getting pregnant when they’re 15 and, like, doing that.  Like, I just-if you can’t have kids that’s great, if you’re smart enough to make a lot of money and you can afford it, awesome for you.  It doesn’t mean it’s going to work.  I don’t-the whole economic disparity doesn’t bother me, because I don’t-I don’t know.</p>
<p>		I also might feel different-I’m still relying on my parents, so-in a year, when I’m paying for everything I might feel differently.  </p></content>

I’m a big believer in PND to get rid of any chance-I have no qualms with abortion.  I have no qualms with terminating  a pregnancy.  I don’t-I’m pro-choice.  My choice is I’m not going to bring a child into the world that is unwanted or unloved.  That’s it.  I want a healthy child.  That could be greedy.  You know, people who have mentally disabled children might take offense to that; I’m sorry.  I respect them for doing it, but I-it’s not my choice.  So PND, if I had a child with Huntington’s, Tay-Sachs, any of those diseases, I have no problems with terminating it.  </p></content>

<p>Q:	Right.  </p>
<p>A:	So the idea of throwing in fertility drugs, which we don’t really know that much about and what they’re going to do long-term, I think that the way it needs to be presented is, well, yeah, we don’t know, but acknowledgement needs to be given to the other factors that contribute to the system going awry.  And genetics is one, and there’s certainly other pieces.  And I think that the fertility drugs, they scare me.  They scare me, and, you know, in telling people about this at a genetic counseling session-you know, for one you have to know they’re freaked.  They’re freaked.  And they’re vulnerable.  And I know a lot of women that have what I have get so scared they don’t think that they can do anything else but lop their boobs off and maybe do a fertility treatment.  To make a decision like that out of fear is dangerous, given the unknowns.  I would feel horrible-you know, like that woman that I know of-I don’t know her directly, the 40-year old woman that had the in vitro-or, she was 37 or whatever when she did it, her son’s three, now that she’s gone.  I would feel terrible to make a decision out of fear and wind up thinking, “Oh my God, because I acted in fear I put myself through something that made me sick.”  You know, I think that the health of the woman needs to be first.  I don’t think you can trade one life for another.  I don’t want to feel that I would be sacrificing my life to have a perfect embryo-</p>
<p>Q:	Right.</p>
<p>A:	Or a perfect fetus, because if that means that-you know, you could have the perfect fetus, and then if you have a dead mother what good was it?  We don’t know that for sure yet.  We don’t know that for sure with this in vitro and the fertility drugs used in association with it, but these things take time.</p></content>

So it was a big, big surgery.  But, at any rate, so then she gets off the bypass table and keeps doing this crazy diet, and eight months later has a near-fatal heart attack.  </p></content>

   <content size="1974"><p>Q:	So these are my last sets of questions for you is um, have to do with actually genetic counseling and these issues of PGD and prenatal diagnosis.  How, if at all, do you think genetic counselors should talk to patients about these options?  So, do you think this is something that should be mentioned to people as a matter of course when they get, let’s say, their genetic testing to begin with?  Should they be told about prenatal diagnosis?  Or I guess I should say PGD because the other-they shouldn’t be told about much until it’s available, but do you think that that should be something discussed during genetic testing?</p>
<p>A:	I think so.  I mean, I feel like-just like my own opinion, I feel like with that sort of thing, people-I know that when I had my genetic testing, like, there was just so much information.  Like of course-and it’s like with any diagnosis, you just don’t know.  There’s just so much information, you’re like, I don’t understand what exactly it is, what my options are down the road.  I feel like it should be mentioned but then maybe not that’s the only time you get it.  These are your options you know.  Down the road if you want to talk about this more again.  I just feel like-</p>
<p>Q:	Sort of like planting the seed, knowing where people are in life that they may not take it.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, and also it just may be too much.  Like if I found that out when I was 23, I’d be like, okay, too much information, I don’t need all this right now, I just need to know like what do I do right now.</p>
<p>Q:	What do I do now, what do I do in six months, yeah.  But just knowing that, having somebody say it.  And if you plan to have children down the road there could be reproductive options you could pursue.</p>
<p>A:	Yes.</p>
<p>Q:	Would be nice to hear.</p>

   <content size="742"><p>Q:	Certainly, in fact, we’re actually waiting to interview anybody who’s had genetic counseling at least six months, just for that very reason because it’s so much information to take in, so much to adapt to.  And is there-uh, let’s see.  Do you think that information is best to come from a genetic counselor or it is best to come from an OB/Gyn, do you think they should be told more about these issues or talking more to patients about these issues?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  I mean, I think coming from a genetic counselor of course, but I see my OB/Gyn annually so I feel like if I were to talk about having a child that I would probably go to her first.  Probably go to the genetic counselor but I would probably go to her first.</p></content>

<p>A:	I don’t have any thoughts.  I mean, I feel like with me, my mom, when she first had the-when she first had breast cancer, she was very young.  And they say that you’re at risk up to four years before the first time that person has breast cancer.  Oh that’s okay, I’m in the same boat.  And so I felt like knowing when I knew was good, just so I knew-because I was 23.  I would have it when I was 27 was the earliest I could get it, so I just knew to prepare and to be on the lookout.

<p>A:	No, I found-there were limited articles about the BRCA testing with PND and PGD.  You needed a password to get onto these medical websites.  I found one sort of a transcript of some notes that was very interesting.  It was more thought-provoking about playing God and should we be doing this, and do you do this when you’re-you know, do you terminate a pregnancy for something that’s just a risk, that’s not a guaranteed disease, it’s not-you know, how far to do people go?

<p>A:	I had an amnio-</p>
<p>Q:	You had an amnio.</p>
<p>A:	For my son, who was the first one, and I was 28, I think.  I was 28.  And at one of my ultrasounds they saw some weird thing that they said later had we done the ultrasound a week before you wouldn’t have seen it.  It was like a line or something.  Had we done it a week after we wouldn’t have seen it.  We happened to do it right at the week when something was forming, and there was a .1% chance that it was something disastrous.  I can’t even remember what it was.  So they said, “Why don’t you do an amnio,” so I did an amnio for that, and it was fine.</p>
<p>Q:	And then you could know whether or not it was that or not that.</p>
<p>A:	Right.  And that’s all I wanted-I didn’t want to know the sex of the baby.  So that was-I just wanted to know, is it good or is it bad?  </p>
<p>Q:	Did you know for either of your children the sex beforehand?  </p>
<p>A:	You know, I didn’t know for Matthew.  But for our daughter, she-I kept wanting to know on the ultrasound, but she kept doing that, like criss-cross with the legs, so we knew-we sort of thought she was a girl, but we weren’t 100% sure.  I wanted to know, but I couldn’t seem to find out. [laughs]</p>

<p>		You know, the genetic counselor I met with, I said this, and she said, “Look, the problem is even if you don’t say anything to them they’re gonna be more savvy than that.  They’re gonna know how your mother died, they’re gonna ask questions.  This information is just gonna be out there.  They’ll hear about it, they’ll read about it.  You know, this will be something that’s out there for them.”  And I think actually that’s probably the hardest part for me, right, knowing-it’s not so much whether they actually have the mutation.  It’s more what is this gonna do for their, you know, expectations and desires for their own future?  </p>
<p>So-all right, so on top of that, so like what if I could get them tested now?  I’m not gonna give them the information.  It’s obviously not helpful to them in any way right now.  So it’s like I would know and then it would really feel like playing God.  Right?  Like, what would I do with that information?  And like how would I know when to tell them-</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.</p>
<p>A:	It’s funny, I really haven’t-it’s like now it’s sort of all coming back to me.  I really haven’t thought about these things in a long time.

I just found out there’s something, you know, wacky with my thyroid, so I’m on Synthroid to regulate that.  I’m talking to my mother, and like, “Oh, your grandmother’s been on that since college.”  Like, okay, this information is helpful for me.  I keep wanting to sit down with them and go through whole family histories of not just cancer but, you know, heart disease, hypertension, cholesterol-like, all of that, for all the family members on both sides of my family, just to get a picture of everything going on so I can see what things I need to be concerned about.  </p></content>

   <content size="639"><p>Then a couple of years later my husband and I were thinking about having kids and we were definitely worried about passing it on.  So as we were thinking about this there was this article in the New York Times showing this beautiful bouncy blond baby who’d been born from PGD and I’m like oh, fascinating.  So we’d been trying for a little while, maybe six to eight months but we weren’t crazy about it, we weren’t trying to figure out our exact days of-we were just kind of having fun so we figured there’s probably nothing wrong we’re just not doing it very carefully.

<p>Q:	Where did you find them?</p>
<p>A:	Oh, very good question.  Well I was writing my Masters project on this so I spent a better part of a year calling Force, calling every doctor that I knew who has dealt with this, using all the connections of the doctors that I’d been to myself .  I put ads on cancer web sites, I just pounded the pavement.  And I found about five or six women who had done it or considered doing it and then I spoke to some of their siblings who’d also considered it and so, you know, just doing the interview process made me realize that maybe-because most of them did not go to a doctor that had specialized in patients with breast cancer.  They just went to standard IVF doctors and had very different protocols than I’d had and they thought that maybe I hadn’t been maxed or-just part of the discussion process back and forth was, they were telling me why don’t you try a regular protocol, a regular cycle and see what happens. </p></content>

   <content size="1637"><p>So we showed up in the office and were like we want to do IVF for PGD and the doctor was completely on board because this is what he specializes in and then he started asking us questions and he was like six to eight months, that’s a pretty long time.  It turns out my husband had a condition that made him relatively infertile, that we didn’t realize was the issue.  Something that should have been corrected when he was born wasn’t corrected until he was 12 and it can cause infertility and it was one of the first questions the doctor asked.  And my husband was like yeah, how did you know?  So he’s like, oh.  </p>
<p>Q:	What condition is it, if you don’t mind me asking?</p>
<p>A:	I don’t know what it’s called but it’s un-descended-</p>
<p>Q:	Oh an un-descended testicle?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah but he was born outside the country and nobody had mentioned in 1971 in Israel that this is something that needs to be corrected.  By the time they got back it was like, he didn’t get it taken care of until much later.  So the chances that we were going to be able to have children together was much lower, it was very, very low.  Then it turns out that I was having problems.  As we continued with the IVF rounds it turns out that my fertility was failing for some bizarre reason.  I just wasn’t making very many eggs, the eggs that I was making were not very hearty so they were also kind of dying.  Very odd.  So between the two of us-this is why we didn’t use birth control-between the two of us the chances of, the statistical possibility of us having children were so low and it didn’t make any sense.  </p></content>

   <content size="1689"><p>A:	It was a no brainer.  We had gone to just discuss this with the doctor and once we realized that is what was necessary to treat this condition it was like of course we’re going to do that.  So that just sealed the whole deal.  And then when the embryos didn’t make it, we started finding out that my eggs as well were having problems.  So that was after the first round.  We found out pretty quickly.  </p>
<p>Q:	Was it the first round where none of the eggs made it?</p>
<p>A:	Yes.    </p>
<p>Q:	And then you have to go through-you decided to go through IVF again.</p>
<p>A:	Right.</p>
<p>Q:	To try and get more eggs.</p>
<p>A:	To try and get more eggs.  Because it might have been, we changed the protocol, we tweaked things, it wasn’t clear-it wasn’t a done deal that it was my eggs, it might have been the protocol so we shifted the protocol for the second time and figured okay let’s try it, maybe I don’t respond to this kind of medication.  Maybe I’d given the trigger to myself wrong.  You know, what it.  We had to do ICSI anyway.  </p>
<p>Q:	So then you decided you’d go through it again.  And you got a couple of eggs that time?</p>
<p>A:	I got three eggs.  Three embryos, sorry.  Three embryos that made it.  And we don’t know, we haven’t PGD’ed them.  They may not, who knows?</p>
<p>Q:	You went through a third cycle of IVF?</p>
<p>A:	Then we went through a third cycle.</p>
<p>Q:	But he didn’t want to do the PGD with just the three embryos, he wanted more?</p>
<p>A:	In fact he doesn’t necessarily want to do it with just the seven. </p>

   <content size="533"><p>A:	I had come out of that cycle of IVF about three months before.  What had happened is that we had done that last round and I’d gotten four embryos, I was still in school, I was so exhausted from all of it.  I was just trying to make it through school, make it through my marriage, make it through IVF.  I just couldn’t do it anymore.  So we took a break.  The doctor wanted me to continue right away because he said my fertility was failing, he wanted me to leave school and just devote full time to this and I refused. </p></content>

<p>Q:	Oh wow.</p>
<p>A:	He’s doing some studies on this because he’s seen it several times over and over again.  He was sort of afraid that once he’d seen-he’d done a couple of ultrasounds and he was seeing things he didn’t like, so he suggested that if I actually wanted to have children what I would have to do is quit school and just do round after round.  I was like I don’t have the money, I don’t have the time and I just can’t mentally do it.  I can’t.  So instead I did the opposite which was I just took a break from it for three months and I just gave my body a break.  He was preparing us for me to use donor eggs and so we went through all the procedures, the medical procedures, the paperwork for that.</p></content>

   <content size="1169"><p>	He basically said that he had been doing studies and had found that his protocol was more progesterone than estrogen.  He just didn’t use estrogen, so felt like that would be a lot safer and hadn’t had any issues.  He’d dealt with women who had cancer at the time and it was okay.</p>
<p>Q:	So you felt comfortable?</p>
<p>A:	I felt comfortable with that.  At one point, in fact, yeah, I did feel comfortable.  And in fact before I finished round three, this was before I became pregnant, it was somewhere in between and I went and scheduled an appointment with him so I could come in and ask him if he’d been as aggressive as he possibly had felt comfortable being and if I wanted to get more aggressive.</p>
<p>Q:	You wanted more ovarian-</p>
<p>A:	I decided I could not do like two more rounds or three more rounds.  If I was going to do another round I wanted to be as aggressive as humanly possible in that last round, get as many as we could, get enough so possibly, so statistically speaking I would have at least one child.  And he told me I’d maxed out, he’d maxed out on everything, he’d actually given me a large amount of hormones.</p></content>

She went to that and it turns out they’re pretty supportive.  Once she heard that, she was like what am I thinking?  If this is something that’s available, then it should be used.

   <content size="1227"><p>my husband had just finished business school at the time and he’s very kind of analytical.  So we sat down and he used-we went out for dinner, a candlelight dinner, it was really nice, to make this decision.  He used an analytic tool that he’d learned in class which is basically a decision tree.  We started out with the pros and cons and what we could do and made our tree.  And as we were sort of getting down to the bottom of that tree, we realize the only thing that was standing in our way-we both really wanted to do it-the only thing that was standing in the way was the cost.  We kind of figured it would be worth it if we could do one round.  So that’s the way we made our decision.  And then I found out later, a little bit later, that my father had taken out a health insurance policy when I was a kid.  What are they called?  It’s like if you get hit by a care or something.  Oh, major medical, something like that.  And he’s kept it up.  It turns out because he’d taken it out in the 70s and IVF wasn’t even invented at the time, they were willing to cover IVF as long as I’d got it diagnosed as infertility. So we were like that takes care of the only thing that’s standing in our way.  </p></content>

And I would have been so upset if I’d found about it after I’d already made my planning decisions.  I don’t know why it’s not-again, I’m the type of person who wants to know my options and I feel like it’s up to our doctors that follow us, especially if I’m being followed specifically for cancer, to let me know what all my options are, especially if they know I’m doing family planning.

<p>Q:	What’s your take?  For you guys that was your best decision to make in this situation.  </p>
<p>A:	I don’t know why FISH isn’t offered along with PGD and put in a file.  I mean it’s done at the same exact time, it doesn’t affect the embryo any differently.  I don’t know why it’s not offered to everyone, put in a file somewhere that they never have to find out just in case.  Because otherwise as someone who’s gone through this it’s just so difficult, you should at least have the option.  But there was only one lab that would do it, Dr. Hughes at-Mark Huges is the guy who does this-</p>
<p>Q:	The FISH?</p>
<p>A:	No, he doesn’t do FISH.  He’s the guy who started this whole PGD in the United States.  I think in fact he was one of the people who came up.  I spoke with him about this and he feels very strongly about not choosing between boys and girls.  He doesn’t do it at all, a lot of people don’t.  I just didn’t get that.

   <content size="1207"><p>A:	Yeah, I did.  I definitely did.  It was only my mom who was a little shaky at first.  Part of it is that she-obviously I told you before that she felt like, she loves her family, she loves her kids, what would happen then?  But I also think she had religious issues.  So she went to a-there’s a lecture series done by Yeshiva University on fertility issues and one of them was on PGD.  She went to that and it turns out they’re pretty supportive.  Once she heard that, she was like what am I thinking?  If this is something that’s available, then it should be used.  I think she just wasn’t sure ethically where she stood on it and it took her a while to sort of come to it.  </p>
<p>Q:	Was it the sort of tampering with God’s will that was getting to her? Or at the point which life begins?</p>
<p>A:	I can’t really speak for her.  I can only tell you my impression and it could be wrong.  I think she just felt like, I think she may have felt a little guilty for passing it on to me and she didn’t have anything available to her at the time and I think she felt a little like, if she had it would she have done it and what about her kids and I think she just felt kind of guilty.</p></content>

I have no idea what people go through.  I never had cancer myself. </p></content>

But I wouldn’t suggest they get tested until later on and it’s up to them to decide.  Forget suggest, I wouldn’t push them to do it, but if they don’t have it then they don’t need to know.  There’s a huge freedom that comes along with that.  They don’t ever need to know that I tested them or that they-yeah.</p></content>

And it is what it is and you know were very lucky to be able to do it.  If we couldn’t have done it, we couldn’t have done it.  There are a lot of thing we can’t do medically speaking that we wish we could.

<p>A:	Right.  Honestly, the first I heard of it I think was when she was first diagnosed with cancer probably, and she had just been thinking about starting to have children with her husband right around that time, and so that was one of her major concerns, and I think she must have-she did a lot of her own research about the BRCA mutation, et cetera, and was definitely looking into that as an option.  And so she had brought that up with us, with the family, so that’s the first that I heard of it.  </p></content>

   <content size="937"><p> I remember her tossing it around, and not-she was more serious about it at first, and I remember sort of her telling me about it, and I was thinking-I do remember.  I remember her, you know, very seriously considering it and thinking that she may terminate the pregnancy if the embryo was positive, and me thinking-I was surprised, I guess.  And I’m very pro-choice, so it wasn’t that.  It was just that I guess I personally, I think I wouldn’t use it as the basis for termination.  I think, like I said before, I would use it-it would really depend on the condition that we were testing for, and to me that wouldn’t be as-I probably wouldn’t even test for it.  So I guess I was surprised that she viewed it that strongly, but she is the one that had cancer, so [laughs]-you know, and then for some reason she sort of abruptly dropped it, and I guess decided the implantation and everything wasn’t worth all of that. </p></content>

<p>A:	I know that it was very-I remember them worrying very much about the cost, and I think they had to go into debt to do it.  And it was, like maybe a yearlong process at least that they were trying.  It was actually probably more than that.  And I know it was very stressful for them.

I think it was a horrible decision to have to make.  It was really heartbreaking.  But from what I know that condition would have drastically decreased that baby’s chances of surviving past a certain age, and she would have had to have major surgery right after birth, and I think she could have had a lot of long-lasting side effects from that.  So, still in my mind it’s much more drastic than the BRCA mutation. </p></content>

   <content size="1058"><p>I think it should be presented.  I think as long as it’s a real option and it could be presented consistently across the board to everyone I think it should.  Because I think it’s helpful for people to know, to have too many options or know all of their possible options than to never have been aware of it, which I think would be terrible.  And I guess it would depend on who it is in terms of, you know, where they are, how old they are and where they are in terms of their own childbearing age, et cetera, and their wishes.  But if they were definitely still considering having children or hadn’t finished their family then, yeah, I would actually say it upfront.  I would say it-I guess, I would say it even in the initial counseling session, before they’ve even been tested.  And maybe not go into too much detail about it, but present it as, “Even if you do carry this mutation,” you know, just to know that that’s still an option.  It doesn’t mean that it’s death for them or death for their offspring either.  You know, that-</p></content>

So I guess I was surprised that she viewed it that strongly, but she is the one that had cancer, so [laughs]-you know, and then for some reason she sort of abruptly dropped it, and I guess decided the implantation and everything wasn’t worth all of that. </p></content>

<p>Q:	But for a woman who’s not in a higher risk category, and it happens somewhere in the thirties that you enter that category, I think they will sometimes do like a preliminary test.  That has a very high rate of false-positives, but if it’s negative then a lot of times people won’t go ahead and do it, yeah.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  I don’t-I don’t think I have had any experience.  I mean my friends who have been pregnant are all around my age, and maybe they have been given the option and they’ve either opted for or against a test like that, but I don’t have any-</p></content>

<p>Q:	Mm-hmm [okay].  Okay.</p>
<p>A:	Because she had been born with this congenital heart disease she was told-first of all, she was supposed to have died at a very young age.  The fact that she lived to be 36 was considered a miracle, because they predicted she would have died in her late teens, early twenties-which is about the time that she gave birth to me, and her cardiologist, who had been treating her since she was a baby, when she first got married, you know, came to the wedding and was like, “Oh, we’re so happy for you.  Congratulations.  For the love of God, please don’t get pregnant.” [laughs] You know, like, “Whatever you do, you will not survive childbirth.  You will not be able to survive a pregnancy and childbirth.”  </p>
<p>		But, lo and behold, my parents got pregnant, and the doctors told my mom-and even my grandparents were encouraging her to have an abortion.  And I think my father, even though he never really told her yes or no, I think-I think everyone in the family was sort of, “If this is going to cost you your life you are permitted to terminate this pregnancy.”  And my mom’s response was, “No way.”  You know, like, “I’m not going to do that to my child.”  And she put her life on the line so that I could be born, and thanks be to God she-she was able to give birth to me, and she, you know, I got ten years with my mom.  </p></content>

   <content size="1041"><p>A:	Yeah, that’s a good question.  Maybe I’ll address first not so much what should or shouldn’t be done, but just a point on how effective it may or may not be.  I think the point at which it was given to me was not the most effective point.  Not that it shouldn’t have been given to me, just to get the most bang for your buck probably when you’re about to go through a mastectomy, and you’re in the middle of chemo, talking about reproductive technologies-</p>

Might I pass it on to them,” and at that point give them that conversation.  But how many people come back to their genetic counselor?  </p>

<p>A:	Because, you know, on the spot you’re not-you’re not thinking, like, “Oh, let me switch my gears, and let me ask you about what you mean when you say that there’s reproductive options.”  But maybe if they gave you something to take home, it gives you the patient the option if you even want to go down that road-</p>
<p>Q:	Mm-hmm [okay]. </p>

But I can imagine how a young woman might feel like, “Well, you know, I don’t want my mother telling me later on that I needed to have had this test done,” or-so, in that regard I think it is a very private thing.  </p>

   <content size="1329"><p>A:	Yeah, I think it’s important, but I don’t think it’s-like I don’t think that it’s an absolute guaranteed right that you should have.  </p>
<p>Q:	Mm-hmm [okay]. </p>
<p>A:	So, if some of these technologies come with the cost of depriving a child, or a young woman, the option of not knowing, I think it’s definitely preferable if she had the choice of deciding whether or not she wants to know, but I don’t think losing that choice, at least right now in my mind, should automatically disqualify a certain procedure.  </p>
<p>Q:	Mm-hmm [okay].  Yeah, we shouldn’t not offer it because of that issue-</p>
<p>A:	Right.  I mean some things the benefit outweighs the cost, and I think-in a perfect world you would always have the option of knowing whether or not you carry this mutation.  But I just don’t-it’s important, I think it’s tremendously important.  It’s a really nice thing to be able to control in your life, but if you weren’t able to, I mean if a child, you know, if the issue is whether or not it’s in his medical records and he comes across it, I mean it’s not an ideal situation, but I don’t think it’s-I don’t think it’s important enough for you to have to be able to make the choice on your own to sort of take away the benefits of being able to do the testing.  </p></content>

You will not be able to survive a pregnancy and childbirth.”  </p>
<p>		But, lo and behold, my parents got pregnant, and the doctors told my mom-and even my grandparents were encouraging her to have an abortion.  And I think my father, even though he never really told her yes or no, I think-I think everyone in the family was sort of, “If this is going to cost you your life you are permitted to terminate this pregnancy.”  And my mom’s response was, “No way.”  You know, like, “I’m not going to do that to my child.”  And she put her life on the line so that I could be born, and thanks be to God she-she was able to give birth to me, and she, you know, I got ten years with my mom.  </p></content>

So to me in that regard abortion is, it’s a terrible thing, but it’s justified if it’s-killing is justified when it’s in self-defense.  To the extent that the abortion is in self-defense I think it is justified.  </p>

The surgeon told me, she said, “You know, I’d even be willing to do another MRI right before the surgery, and if it looks like the cancer is all gone we can just do a lumpectomy.  But, you are so young that I still think a mastectomy is the best idea.”  And, you know, I didn’t flinch, I was like, “All right, that’s all I need to know.

At that point I was just like, well, I’m not even going to live to, you know, to see my 30th birthday.

<p>Q:	Mm-hmm [okay]. </p>
<p>A:	I said pretend and live your life as if you’re positive.  What would you do knowing you were positive?  Would you go ahead before a cancer diagnosis and do a prophylactic mastectomy?  If not, then do what you would do if you knew.  Go for two mammograms a year, sonograms alternatingly, do vaginal sonograms, take a CA-125-pretend you’re positive.  The knowledge is very heavy.  As heavy as you think it might be-and I already had breast cancer-it’s huge.  It’s like the way I already know my parable-like, what I compare it to people is it’s like as if somebody would tell a man, “You’re going to die of a heart attack.  That is how you will die.”  Every time he gets short of breath he’s going to think, “This is it.”  You know, every time he feels a missed beat or whatever, it’s just, it makes you so stressed.  It’s so stressful.  You kind of can’t-I don’t-I can’t take it out of my mind fully.  So I would’ve rather pretended to be positive and then acted accordingly.  I think I would’ve done all the same things, but the off hope that I wouldn’t, I think I would’ve been able to live more peacefully thinking, “Maybe”-</p></content>

Like, when we want to do advertisements we’ll get responses from certain Jewish publications where they’ll say, “Sure you can advertise the Sharsheret organization, but you can’t mention breast and you can’t mention cancer.”  So I’m like, “Okay”-</p>

If not, then do what you would do if you knew.  Go for two mammograms a year, sonograms alternatingly, do vaginal sonograms, take a CA-125-pretend you’re positive.  The knowledge is very heavy.  As heavy as you think it might be-and I already had breast cancer-it’s huge.  It’s like the way I already know my parable-like, what I compare it to people is it’s like as if somebody would tell a man, “You’re going to die of a heart attack.  That is how you will die.”  Every time he gets short of breath he’s going to think, “This is it.”  You know, every time he feels a missed beat or whatever, it’s just, it makes you so stressed.  It’s so stressful.  You kind of can’t-I don’t-I can’t take it out of my mind fully.  So I would’ve rather pretended to be positive and then acted accordingly.  I think I would’ve done all the same things, but the off hope that I wouldn’t, I think I would’ve been able to live more peacefully thinking, “Maybe”-</p></content>

But, again, I already had one child before I knew, another child after I knew, so-you know, it’s like if I didn’t do it for my one kid because I didn’t have a choice it would almost seem wrong to do anything that would have manipulated that for my other-to me.

I think it should be in the initial-like, at least glossed over in the initial counseling session, and then maybe if they-you know, you don’t want to waste too much time since they’re at least here.  I know they’re so backed up it’s completely ridiculous, so-[laughs] you don’t want to waste too much time on it, but you can maybe gloss over it.  And then if they have the gene, when they come back in, since this may all float over their head that might be a good thing to kind of give them in a hand out to take home with them and peruse later.</p></content>

   <content size="854"><p>A:	The other thing is, I mean even if they get that invitation-or, being realistic, if they got some kind of a phone call following up and reminding about it, and saying perhaps this is something you want to meet with the doctor to discuss or something-you know, it doesn’t have to necessarily be the geneticist.  Maybe it’ll put it in their heads to talk to their own gynecologist or to, like-</p>
<p>Q:	Sure.</p>
<p>A:	I talk to my doctor here about it when I’m-and my regular gynecologist I talk to-you know, they both tell me whatever’s going on, and-</p>
<p>Q:	Okay.</p>
<p>A:	If they’re positive they should be doing some screenings.  They should be seeing some doctor who has some knowledge who could fill in that gap, I think.  And since I do the most minimal screening you could do I would think that I’m a good example.  </p></content>

But, again, I already had one child before I knew, another child after I knew, so-you know, it’s like if I didn’t do it for my one kid because I didn’t have a choice it would almost seem wrong to do anything that would have manipulated that for my other-to me.

   <content size="1299"><p>Q:	So what else do you remember from the Hadassah article that struck you?</p>
<p>A:	Well that was the first time that I ever thought about so many-really thought about it.  I guess I’d thought about it in passing, but, you know, so much has changed just in the last couple of years.  Like, when I had my genetic testing nobody mentioned to me the possibility of going anywhere in the world and having this done anyway.  You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Q:	Okay.</p>
<p>A:	So it’s not like it was even out there to do for my son anyway.  But, you know, and I wouldn’t have gone off to Israel to do it, that’s for sure, so if it wasn’t the standard thing here-[laughs]</p>
<p>Q:	Okay.</p>
<p>A:	But it was just-I don’t know.  It’s like, as you said, it’s an adult-onset thing, and one who is in this situation has to believe that something’s going to change by the time my children grow up, because that’s the only way you can, like, keep your sanity in this situation, I think.  </p>
<p>		So I don’t think I ever-I know I never would have gone and done it, even for my son knowing, because I just have to believe that something’s going to happen between now and the next 17 years that’s going to make it easier, better and different for my kids than it is for me. </p></content>

   <content size="1312"><p>So, what had you heard about preimplantation genetic diagnosis, especially for BRCA, before today?  </p>
<p>A:	Well I think, like, I learned a lot from two things.  One is an article that was in Hadassah Magazine-if you’ve seen it-that talked about what they’ve done there, and somebody-I don’t think she’d had the baby yet, but was about to have the baby, and a couple of other people that were pregnant, and the Orthodox view in doing all that, which was kind of interesting.  And then-</p>
<p>Q:	What was the Orthodox perspective?  I don’t remember.  </p>
<p>A:	I don’t remember how many cells it is, but when an embryo reaches a certain number of cells, I think 12 but don’t hold me to it-</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah-</p>
<p>A:	[laughs]-then you can't terminate it, or dispose of it, whatever term you want to use.  But if it’s like the six or eight cells you still can.  So that’s why it’s okay for them to go through this whole process as long as they make their decision when it's still six or eight cells. [laughs]</p>
<p>Q:	From your gestures it sounds like that means it’s like splitting hairs for you?  I mean is it fuzzier for you?</p>

<p>Q:	Okay.</p>

<p>A:	[overlapping] rabbis who got together and decided that by interpreting the Bible that’s good with them.  That’s what I’m saying.  You know, it’s like it doesn’t matter what movement you’re in, there still seems to be loopholes, and to me that was like a loophole.  But-they also believe in being fruitful and multiplying, and this woman, you know, is being fruitful and multiplying by doing this, so, okay, good.  I don’t know.  It was a little sketchy to me.

   <content size="2702"><p>and my grandmother is going to be-she just turned 89.  She’s kind of like, has a hard enough time dealing with the fact that my mother is sick, let alone-there’s no way she would understand all this.  So, like the counselors when they did our blood tests were like begging us to bring her in to get a blood test, and we refused to do it, because she’s-you know, we can’t ask her to do that.  I know it would be nice for them to have the information, but she wouldn’t understand it, and it would be too overwhelming to her.  And, you know, and my grandfather’s dead, so there’s no-and I-I mean, from looking at that picture, it’s probably from my grandfather’s side of the family anyway, so there again you’re putting my grandmother through that most likely for no reason.  </p>
<p>		But the weird thing was my aunt got tested and she tested negative, but my uncle went in with her to get her results, because that’s when they still had you come in no matter what.  For some reason the geneticist just asked my uncle if he would be tested-no idea why still.  I don’t even think she knows why.  </p>
<p>Q:	I’m sorry, your uncle, this is your biological uncle, your aunt’s husband?</p>
<p>A:	My aunt’s husband.</p>
<p>Q:	Okay.</p>
<p>A:	Nobody knows why they asked him.</p>
<p>Q:	And this aunt is your mother’s-</p>
<p>A:	Oh, you know why?  Because I think in casual conversation my aunt commented on this little cluster of breast cancer in his family.  So the geneticist said, “Since you’re here and you’ve heard the whole shtick, can we just test you?”  He has BRCA1.  </p>
<p>Q:	And that’s where your cousins got-</p>
<p>A:	That’s why my two cousins got tested.  </p>
<p>Q:	Wow.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.</p>
<p>Q:	Okay.</p>
<p>A:	Because he happened to be sitting in the room and the woman’s like, “Didn’t you mention that there was a lot of breast cancer in his family?”  He’s like, “Oh, I’m here.  Go ahead, test.”  </p>
<p>		But he just assumed nothing was-especially because his mother lived to be the great, miserable old age of 90-something, and so he’s-</p>
<p>Q:	This isn’t the one in Florida, is it?</p>
<p>A:	No. [laughs] </p>
<p>Q:	A different one. </p>
<p>A:	Not an actual relative of mine. [laughs]</p>
<p>Q:	Okay.</p>
<p>A:	And so he just figured, “My mother lived, all of her sisters are the ones who died.  I’m not going to have it, go ahead.”  And then they’re like, “Yeah, you need to come back in.  You have BRCA1.”  And he’s like, “Excuse you?”  And then both of his daughters have it.</p>

   <content size="2767"><p>A:	This whole thing is very dicey in my family.  It took like two and a half years to talk my brother into getting genetic testing, and he finally did it and he won’t tell any of us the results, which is, like, causing massive amounts of fighting and tension between all of us.  And, you know, on one hand maybe he’s not telling us because he thinks that I’ll be jealous because he doesn’t have it, and on the other hand maybe he’s not telling us because he doesn’t want my mom to have the added stress of knowing he does have it.  But who knows, because he won’t tell us.  </p>
<p>Q:	Is she functioning like he does have it and he’s-</p>
<p>A:	She’s functioning like she’s ready to kill him.  Beyond that I don’t know.  It depends on the day.  It depends on the day.</p>
<p>Q:	Okay.  </p>
<p>A:	[laughs]</p>
<p>Q:	Is he married with children as well?</p>
<p>A:	He is, and he has two daughters.  </p>
<p>Q:	Okay.</p>
<p>A:	So-and at first he couldn’t even see the point of doing it till they were much older, until he slowly started hearing us about, like all the risks that are elevated for men too, after we repeated it over and over and over.  And after he went for his genetic counseling I happened to be visiting him and he came back in a dull panic, with, like, lists of, “Are you doing this, and are you doing this, and are you doing this?”  And I’m like-[laughs]</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.</p>
<p>A:	But then, now he won’t tell me, so I’m like, hmm-you will never know anything I’m doing.  But-</p>
<p>Q:	So you haven’t shared your treatment plans or your monitoring plans with him either?  </p>
<p>A:	Well, I mean he knows that I do some things from like that initial conversation.  But, like I said to my husband and my father that when I do have an oophorectomy if either of them tell him that I had it they should watch out. [laughs]</p>
<p>Q:	So is that as a punishment for him not telling you, or is it just you’re not going to talk about it at all?</p>
<p>A:	It’s like, his wife-I don’t want to tell any of my friends, like-</p>
<p>Q:	Okay.</p>
<p>A:	I don’t want to make it common-my in-laws don’t know that I even have the gene.  Like, not-if any of my friends know it’s because they’ve guessed, not because I’ve told them.  You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Q:	Okay.</p>
<p>A:	So, my cousins know, my brother knows, but not too many people know, and I’m kind of like, when I have the surgery I don’t need too many people to know.  </p>
<p>Q:	Okay.</p>
<p>A:	So-</p>
<p>Q:	Why is it that you’ve kept it close to the chest, so to speak-[laughs] bad metaphor, I apologize.</p>

<p>		But, to get back to my point about why I won’t tell him above all else-</p>
<p>Q:	Yes, yes, yes-</p>

<p>Q:	Okay.</p>

<p>Q:	Okay.</p>
<p>A:	Which I know is very immature.  </p>
<p>Q:	Well, I’m wondering if that-just, is that more of the pattern you have in your relationship with him?  Is that common, or is this something unique to your relationship?  </p>
<p>A:	I have a feeling health-wise he now keeps a lot of secrets from us.  I have a feeling.  But in general that was never our pattern before-before he met her, and before, you know, all this stuff.  Like, we know he has, like high blood pressure, this and that, but he won’t talk about anything anymore.  It’s all like, for his family, which we are not.  </p>

And he wanted to finish school before they got married, so it’s been a two-year engagement, which is like eating away at her, because she just wants to have these kids-</p>

But as far as I know you’re not going to have any effects from this until you’re a grown adult who can make decisions and do whatever for yourself, and you can still nip it in the bud and bring yourself down to the normal risk level quite-not pleasantly and not happily, but easily.  </p>

She’s kind of like, has a hard enough time dealing with the fact that my mother is sick, let alone-there’s no way she would understand all this.  So, like the counselors when they did our blood tests were like begging us to bring her in to get a blood test, and we refused to do it, because she’s-you know, we can’t ask her to do that.

<p>Q:	Yeah.</p>
<p>A:	I remember being shocked and upset and crying, and I can tell you exactly where I was, because I was driving home from work, and I remember nobody had mentioned to me when she started all these tests, even though she and my dad knew and they deny it, nobody mentioned that it might be cancer.  And my father worked in the pharmaceutical industry, so even when he told me he told me in some way that I had no idea what he was saying, and I’m like, “Can you just say that in English?”  He said, “It’s cancer,” and I was like, “Whoa.”  But still, I thought it was like breast cancer, I thought it was all fine.  It took a while-like, while she was in the hospital it slowly started dawning on me that it wasn’t so fine.  And then when my brother told me what suboptimally debulked meant-because I’d never heard of that-</p>

Sometimes I make her feel more guilty and upset when I get really, you know, angry and I’m like, “Thanks for doing this to me.” [laughs] But, you know, I mean, she’s also kind of a pragmatic sort of person who’s like-you know?  It’s more like she’ll fight with my dad because I’ll say that when I have the surgery, because I don’t want to tell my friends I want my dad to come upstate with me and take my kids to school and stuff, and my dad’s like, “No,” and my mom’s like, “I won’t be here and you better do it,” and dat-da-da-da-“You owe this to her because it’s my fault.”  So-</p>

She thinks if she goes and tells him things he’ll turn around and tell, which is not going to work.  She’s kind of like, you know, arm wrestling, and she’s going to lose.

You know, even with it, like if you look at my one friend, there’s so much tragedy, so much failure, so much money that could be spent so many better ways spent on this.  I mean it’s a big, booming, expensive business, and there’s still all those kids who need those families who are still sitting around in orphanages because you spent your $60,000, and, you know-I’m pretty ambivalent.  </p></content>

<p>Q:	Yeah.</p>
<p>A:	If they couldn’t have a child, if there was no way to get a child, maybe I’d feel differently.  But there’s millions of ways to get children, some of which cost no money, some of which still cost a lot of money, but all those children need a home, and I don’t know if you should be messing with all this stuff.  Like, maybe if you can’t have a baby there’s a reason you can’t have a baby, and you should just let it go at that.  </p>

Because for the whole time we were waiting for his results to come, which was like two weeks, we were fighting, because I was like, “No, I don’t want to do that.  I want to adopt if we both have it.  I don’t want to,”-he’s like, “Let’s just”-you know, “You get pregnant and we’ll do amnio.”  I’m like I would never, ever, ever terminate a pregnancy, no matter what-</p>

   <content size="1429"><p>you just have to hope that whatever happens you can handle.  I mean, like we have a friend, Farrah, my daughter has a friend who, the mother adopted both kids because she couldn’t get pregnant, and she adopted the older one from Russia and everything’s fine and dandy.  She adopted the younger one from Trenton, and he was born really early, and she just like raced off to Trenton and there he was, born really early, and he has cerebral palsy.  And it’s a-she’s tiny, she’s like 4’9”, his mom-it’s a mind boggling task, physically, emotionally, mentally-he’s six, he still can’t sleep through the night-to take care of this child.  But she’s like, “This was my blessing from God and this was”-she could have-you know, she didn’t know he had CP, but she knew something was seriously wrong, because you have a month to decide if you’re going to keep a baby in a domestic adoption like that.  And, you know, they found out two days after it was official, after the month was over, what it was.  But she knew something was seriously wrong, and some people would have turned around and given that child back, or not even taken that child home.  She’s like, “God destined this child to me and he’s mine and whatever comes with that comes with that.”  And, you know, you just have to hope that you’re the type of person that has the strength to meet something like that the way she has.  </p></content>

If down the road it will change something, if down the road they have a vaccine or they can make a quick little switch and the kid won’t have the BRCA gene, I don’t know.

<p>A:	No. [laughs]</p>
<p>Q:	Okay.  That’s fine.</p>
<p>A:	Occasionally, in passing.  But no.  I mean that ties into, again, going back to my mother, much more complicated issues, because that means, you know, first my mother will have died and there’ll be all that to deal with, and then my kids will-especially my inquisitive daughter is older and will want to know-like, she knows my mom’s sick, kinda sorta, but only kinda sorta, and she doesn’t really know what’s wrong with her.  And she’s never known her well.  </p>
<p>Q:	Right.  </p>
<p>A:	So even though she gets more tired and can do less, she’s never known her as, like the functional, vibrant person that she was.  Ever.  She doesn’t remember her from when she was born, and my son certainly has never known her any other way.  So, to me it all kind of ties in together as they get older and they hopefully, at least she remembers her and asks questions, and what was wrong with grandma and blah, blah, blah, and, you know, knows things in the world.

She went for her genetic testing, her mom has BRCA2-she’s going, she’s already like I’ve got to get my ovaries out, I already have two kids, like my doctor told me I could go on a low dose birth control and think about it.  And I said no, my experience and my data shows you need an oophorectomy, at what point in time you need that oophorectomy, that’s subject to whatever.  She’s making herself-she overloaded, overwhelmed just having endured the-now granted she’s had her two children and she doesn’t have any plans to have additional.  But I think she’s more typical of somebody who might be overwhelmed opposed to me who’s more medically minded and she’s more of a lay person and I think if you overloaded her with more information about that I think it just is too much, and I think it only becomes an issue if they’re positive.  And then only if they’re not done childbearing.  If they’re done childbearing then obviously it’s like a moot issue.  But if they’re not and they’re thinking about it, I think only at that point, I feel like maybe at the time that the results are delivered that you have counseling is family planning part of your long term plan and then if so let’s talk about blah blah blah. </p></content>

<p>Q:	Because?  Until you decided to have the surgery or until after the surgery?</p>
<p>A:	After the surgery, I think after the surgery you realize wow, they’re not yours.  You feel different.  I don’t feel differently like in clothes at all.  I feel like, I mean I feel like maybe people look at me and think I had an augmentation, you know, a regular breast augmentation because I’m tiny and I might have had a boob job.  But I-</p>
<p>Q:	But you said even beforehand-</p>
<p>A:	Even beforehand I was of this size, I didn’t go any larger.  I think when I’m in the privacy of my own home and like I look in the mirror I think that you definitely, they’re not yours and nothing about them is real.  So I definitely think it impacts psychosexual and otherwise but I’m okay with it.  And I haven’t really sought any counseling or anything like that, I’m managing it.  </p></content>

<p>A:	No, there wasn’t any-my doctors at Sloan actually were not, it wasn’t even on the radar.  They basically said until your 35 at which point we’ll think about doing ultrasounds and CA-125s.  But CA-125 is really only helpful when you’re following an ovarian cancer that’s already there.  It’s not really helpful as a screening tool and obviously there’s a lot of false positives because Ca-125 can be elevated for numerous reasons [laughs].

<p>Q:	There’s no risk for continuing, is there?</p>
<p>A:	Well there’s risk for the breast, but now that I actually have had my surgery now I feel kind of like I’m not really so worried.  And plus there are studies now that are showing people who have their ovaries out are using-and for mutation carriers-there are doctors who are giving supplemental estrogen back.

I guess it will be a real interesting year to have my sister have her baby because no one really-seeing my friends with my kids, nothing’s really made me gung-ho about wanting a family.

And I actually, I really liked it because I felt like-at that point I knew my status.  And without sharing it with other patients I just felt like I could really empathize with them.  And I also think that having seen it is so incredibly helpful as somebody who had to undergo it because cosmetically, aesthetically, I knew exactly what it was going to be like, look like, not feel-the surgery is really a major surgery and you can never know what that feels like until you undergo it.

   <content size="601"><p>  So you’d heard about preimplantation genetic diagnosis before this, which is somewhat unique with the people we’re talking to.  So tell me how you came to be presented with that.  </p>
<p>A:	It was that specialist who, in asking all about-you’ll have to excuse my voice.  I’m a little bit sick.  In giving her my background, I told her I was a BRCA carrier and she just said, “You know, it’s out there that you can choose an embryo that doesn’t-you can test embryos.  So if you wanted that then you would do IVF.  But just to let you know it’s a possibility.”  So that was-</p></content>

   <content size="1099"><p>So, let’s talk about preimplantation genetic diagnosis, which is the one with IVF.  So, have you-do you know people who’ve gone through IVF?  You’ve seen the process?  </p>
<p>A:	Mm-hmm [yes].</p>
<p>Q:	Okay.  Good experiences, bad experiences?  </p>
<p>A:	I mean, ultimately good, because they got pregnant.  I mean I had one friend who went though four cycles.  And, you know, I think-I wasn’t friends with her at the time, but I think it was a long and difficult time.  But she has two healthy, beautiful kids and so-</p>
<p>Q:	Twins?</p>
<p>A:	No, not twins.</p>
<p>Q:	Oh, okay.  </p>
<p>A:	So the first one was IVF and the second one happened on its own.</p>
<p>Q:	On its own, okay.</p>
<p>A:	And I have a couple of friends who are doing it now, so I think-you know, there’s a lot of hope behind it, and it usually seems to work, so-</p>
<p>Q:	So, does watching people go through it, given that you got at least close, if not engaged in the process, is that a scary thing?  Is it-you said hopeful?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  </p>

<p>Q:	Yeah, from your friends?  Yeah, you said-yeah, yeah.  You said that.  </p>
<p>		So, you would personally consider it.  You talked about some of those decisions.  Let’s see-okay.  So there are some concerns about taking hormones to stimulate egg production for women who are already at increased risk of ovarian cancer, and the research is just starting to come out.  We don’t really have any definitive data.  Is that of concern at all, that there might be some health risks associated with going through the procedure?</p>
<p>A:	Mm-hmm [yes].  Yeah.</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>A:	I mean, as I said, the doctor gave me a prescription for something that was not Clomid.  It did not increase the estrogen, so it had its own side effects, and it was, you know, a couple babies it caused these horrible things, but overall it was-you know, so-but she did, she was sensitive about it and gave me something else.  </p>

<p>A:	Mm-hmm [yes].  You know, I don’t even know that she gave me the choice.  I think she said, “We’re not going to give you Clomid because it increases the estrogen.  We’re going to give you this instead.”  </p></content>

<p>Q:	Yeah, yeah, yeah-</p>
<p>A:	But I also at that point wouldn’t have known anyone who had IVF, so I would have known less about it, I think.  </p>
<p>Q:	That makes sense.  Does knowing more make it easier or harder to contemplate using it?  </p>
<p>A:	I think probably easier, because it’s pretty common, especially in New York, and among my friends who are sort  of in that age group. </p></content>

   <content size="467"><p>PND isn’t currently being used, but could in the future.  So how do you think genetic counselors should talk about this during genetic counseling sessions, if at all?  </p>

I think some people will want to know that, and if it’s something that rules their lives then they might make a different decision than I would.</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.</p>

And there’s also the Ashkenazi Jewish, I guess my mom technically would be an Ashkenazi Jew, so that along with her getting sick early, they said I guess those few things is enough for us to test you.  It was sort of a research based testing so I had to fill certain criteria in order for them to test me and I guess I just sort of made it.  So they were actually quite surprised when I tested positive, she’d only given me about a 20% chance of testing positive.

   <content size="1770"><p>Had you heard anything about pre-implementation genetic diagnosis for BRCA before today?</p>
<p>A:	I guess the only time that I maybe heard it mentioned a little bit was when I had my counseling appointment with Dr. Offit [ph 3:51] several years ago.  I think I was actually pregnant at the time and he sort of mentioned it off the cuff that this was an option that you could screen the embryos beforehand and either, obviously look for an embryo without the mutation or also screen by sex and choose like male versus female, that kind of thing.  But other than that, no I was never informed by my gynecologist or anything like that.  </p>
<p>Q:	So it was sort of mentioned in passing during your genetic counseling.</p>
<p>A:	Yes.</p>

<p>A:	Yeah [laughs] I had had some counseling before that, I actually was tested in Toronto-I’m Canadian-I was tested in Toronto and shortly after I tested positive I moved here and the woman I was seeing there had recommended Dr. Offit, that I should maybe pay him a visit.  So that’s why I went in for that one appointment.  I’m trying to think what my reaction would be.  I guess it was more of a surprise reaction, like oh you can do that type reaction.

<p>A:	I guess more whether I would do either of them myself.  I’m sort of past that point now so I guess I’m not planning to have any more children so I wouldn’t really have to sit down and think about it.  I think [pause] I would definitely lean toward one option more than the other for various reasons.  PGD, I don’t think would be something I would consider necessarily. However the prenatal testing I would probably consider that.  Although if I found the answer I’m not sure I would choose to do anything about it because I feel like if you were to, you know, carry the child knowing that they have the mutation, like you said there’s a lot of options for them in terms of screening.  And by the time they get to the age where it might become a factor, 40 years from now or whatever, there’s probably going to be a lot of things in place that will be available to them.</p>

<p>A:	I’m not sure if it was only mentioned because I was pregnant at the time he said oh yeah by the way, you could do this if you’re planning to have more children.  Like I said at the time I wasn’t planning to have any more so I really didn’t give it a lot of thought but I did get what he was saying, I understood what he was telling me.  Like hey that’s kind of cool.  I think definitely for women who are obviously childbearing age-</p>
<p>Q:	It’s important to know.</p>
<p>A:	The more options you’re given, the better I think.</p></content>

   <content size="708"><p> And how much information?  I guess it depends at what stage that person’s at.  If they’re thinking I would like to have children in the next year or two years, then the more information the better or you have another session, say oh you can come back and get some more information on this because there’s a lot of things you need to take in.  I think the most important part is the screening and what you should be doing to take care of yourself and then after comes all of the other things like something like this.  Maybe it could be like you mention it and you say okay if you want more specifics or whatever you can let us know when you’re ready to make these kind of decisions, I guess. </p></content>

<p>A:	Right, right.  I think that’s an important choice because I think, like I said when I was making the choice I talked to a lot of different people and just sort of bounced ideas back and forth, whether or not this was something they would want to know or not know.  I’d say 80% said yes, they would want to know and maybe 20% said no, I wouldn’t want to know.

<p>A:	Right, right, I’m sorry [laughs].  I think one of things that I’ve focused on, in terms of this, in terms of children, is that I’m at an age that even if I didn’t have it my options for having children are getting less and less or my years of thinking about it are less and less since I’m 38.

But with the BRCA I think it’s more complicated just in terms of getting pregnant, the risks that are involved in getting pregnant with it, whether or not I instead-I think that I might want to get my ovaries out at some point.  I used to say by the time I’m 40 I want to get my ovaries out, but that’s two years from now, a year and a half from now so that is no longer so arbitrary.</p></content>

   <content size="1192"><p>It was enough in that, well it made us want to get more information and probably the best place to get more information was from a doctor who specializes in it versus the genetic counselor.  So my memory of how she presented was something like some people choose to do this, I have some patients that have done it, it’s not terribly common but I can give you more information about it.  I think that given-I suppose [pause] I think that might be the best way to go about it because when we went to see the reproductive endocrinologist, it was like a sea of statistics of this and you know.  And like if you were trying to mix that whole sea of statistics in that initial other sea of statistics of what you’re at risk for if you are positive, I think it could get kind of confusing and too much.  And so, I guess the genetic counselors need to kind of consider what’s the right amount of information to give at that visit so that the real issues of being positive and what that means for your life are-because it’s already so confusing and it’s so emotional so it’s hard to get your head around it.  Then to get a barrage of other details about PGD could be overwhelming.  </p></content>

Who was I going to see for surveillance and making appointments for all that and then having this other thing to deal with that was a little more future oriented but not forgetting to do that.  And I don’t remember how long we waited but I do remember I called back awhile later to get the names.  In a way that’s sort of what I did but I did it on my own and it might be good because I think it’s possible I could have forgotten.  Or that would just be a piece of information, like I can’t remember if we talked about it at UCLA.  It was maybe a piece of information that just slipped off.  So maybe having something, like a follow-up could be useful. </p></content>

   <content size="1288"><p>A:	What I remember is that, you know, that IVF doesn’t work all the time anyway so you could go through all of this and you wouldn’t have anything.  But then furthermore when you take the one cell out then many of the embryos die so then even if you had eight to begin with and then whatever, you took the cells out and some of those would die and then by the time you implant them and it just made it clear that the likelihood of it resulting in a pregnancy was maybe even worse by a number of factors including my age and just the risks of the IVF and the risks of the testing itself.  And that even if, like you said, even if you test and then you implant one that you’re pretty darn sure doesn’t have it, it could be a mosaic and it turns out it did have it.  So all of those things combined and then also the difficulty of doing the IVF and the expense of it, though I don’t think the expense would have stopped us because it’s such an important thing we would have made the decision without it.

Then my mother’s cousin’s wife died, somebody I knew that I would see at Seder and seemed really nice and she passed away when I was a teenager so I knew about that.  And then stories of cousins of my mother’s in Israel who had died of breast cancer when they were quite young.  But other than that, no friends or peers that I can think of.</p></content>

Anyway, from talking with my mom’s colleagues and the people who tested me at UCLA and then I came here to Sloan Kettering and I met with the genetic counselor and I told her I wasn’t ready to get tested yet but I was just trying to get some more information about how do they keep their files and would other people know and what do they recommend and whatever.  After all that I decided to get tested and I did it again because at that point it was important to me that if it was going to be in my record anyway that [pause] the health insurance should cover it.

<p>A:	Yeah.  It’s good because like I had described before, in my family we try not to dwell which is good for our mental health but not so good for getting stuff done.

<p>A:	So now I’m sort of in freeform.

It does, I mean the concerns I have about the ovarian the oophorectomy is that, you know, that I’ll have this early menopause and that will change my outside appearance I’m sure and will change, more importantly sort of my-could change my internal sense of who I am, my hormones-it’s impossible to know how it will end up changing me but I recognize that-</p>

<p>Q:	Too much.</p>
<p>A:	Time pressure.  And then the other thing is I love breastfeeding, it’s amazing.  It’s scary because I don’t want to die and I don’t want to put myself at any more risk or put my family at any more risk of losing me but I really would like to breastfeed.  If I’m lucky enough to have another kid I would really like to breastfeed that child so we talked about it.  I was surprise, I thought my husband would be like really scared by that and he was actually really great.  Because I realized for a few months as I was breastfeeding my daughter I was realizing how much I liked it and how important it felt and what a blessing it is and then to-so I started thinking gosh I can’t believe I wouldn’t do this for the second kid.  And I know the kid would be fine and you know, formulas, fine and my sister had formulas, it’s okay.  But it wasn’t what was in my heart.  So when I talked to him about it I was surprised for him to sort of say listen, if that’s important to you it’s couple more years and we can ask about what the incremental risk is but you know okay.</p>
<p>Q:	Are you feeling like you have to have the second one faster?</p>
<p>A:	Not-I don’t think so, not any faster than we would have anyway because I don’t have a lot of time for my fertility. </p>
<p>Q:	So you’re thinking the next year or so?</p>
<p>A:	Honestly it’s more my school schedule that will dictate it.  I think if it weren’t for me being in stupid medical school I would do it sooner but I kind of can’t.  So I think what we will try to do is to get me through, to get me pregnant at the end of my intern year.  So that will be 2011.  </p>
<p>Q	Okay.  So 40ish?  And that feels comfortable for you in terms of your risk?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  It’s the best we’ve come to.  I’d rather do-in some ways it’s like it would be better to be earlier but I don’t really know how to work that with my training and then you’re sort of quibbling months so whatever.  </p></content>

Theoretically maybe if we could and then program our children exactly so, that would feel like too much intervention, but I think-off the top of my head, without having like a specific case to consider I think if there’s a disease that we know a genetic link to that significantly impacts life or like lifestyle, quality or life and also length of life, that if parents want to consider doing PGD for that it seems reasonable.</p></content>

<p>A:	Yeah.  [pause] I guess not.  I don’t, I think we should fix the system I don’t think we should deny people who can afford it the ability to do it.  We should find a way to make it more equitably available to everybody. But given the imperfections of our system right now, I don’t think it’s right to deny it to everybody.  </p></content>

   <content size="3254"><p>So that was January 7th when I got my results.  Immediately I was hit with a ridiculous level of anxiety, I’m sure I’m predisposed to it, but I couldn’t sleep at night, I couldn’t stay asleep in the mornings, I was crying all of the time.  Not because I was afraid of doing surgery and not because I was afraid of getting cancer, but because I felt like I had to make a decision: should I make a baby today?  Or should I do this and push it off?  Am I being a chicken?  Am I chickening out of having a family?  What’s my problem?  There were a lot of things going on in my life at that point.  I was back and forth for a while.  I went to Cornell also to check with, to get opinions from their oncologist.  Actually my breast doctor here thought that it would be a very radical move and that I shouldn’t go forward with the surgery.  </p>
<p>Q:	With the prophylactic mastectomy?</p>
<p>A:	She’s like I think that’s a little crazy and I was surprised.  I was just going from doctor to doctor, breast surgeon to oncologist to plastic surgeon just to hear their opinion.  I basically wanted someone to tell me what to do.  Should I have a kid first or should I do the surgery first?  Should I have the opportunity to breastfeed a child or should I-it did not help to hear, oh you know some people can’t breastfeed anyway.  That didn’t help to hear because I didn’t think that would be my problem.  It actually kind of offended me when a doctor said to me, you know it’s not all it’s cracked up to be.  That’s not what I was asking for.  I was asking do you think I’ll get breast cancer or not?  And no one could answer that because 1% is a very small number but when you fall into it’s a very big number.  Finally I spoke to a rabbi and this is after months of ripping my hair out.  And he said-</p>
<p>Q:	Is this your family rabbi?</p>
<p>A:	You know, because I don’t have parents and because all of us kids kind of went off on our own, he’s not a family rabbi.  He’s somebody that I knew, my friend’s uncle, he’s from my hometown and I always trusted him to be a very intelligent man.  He knew my father, he knew my mother, he knew my grandfather.  And it was my friend who said why don’t you speak to my uncle.  He called me which was really sweet and he told me that when it comes to matters of life and death, you don’t take chances.  If having cancer, if developing that first cell is going to put you at risk because it’s such an aggressive form of cancer that the rest of your life you’re going to have to worry about getting it again, and the only thing holding you back from preventing that is breastfeeding, I really suggest you do this.  And I also think that once you do it your anxiety levels are going to go down.  I knew your parents, I knew what they went through, maybe this is a way of kind of removing yourself from that past.  So that’s when I made the decision to go forward with it.  I called a doctor on March 11th and I did surgery on March 18th and everything’s been-Percocet’s definitely helped me relax.  [laughs]  But I did need anti-anxiety medications.</p>
<p>Q:	Did those start before your genetic testing or since?</p>
<p>A:	No, since the genetic testing.</p></content>

   <content size="2008"><p>Q:	So tell me, I want to check in about your feelings about the presentation and what you were thinking about the presentation.</p>
<p>A:	I mean I thought it was very informative.  A couple of things I guess were new, but nothing actually earth shattering.  These were all things that I’ve heard about and considered and almost seems as if the presentation wants the person to think a particular way. </p>
<p>Q:	Oh, that’s good to know.  What was your sense about it-</p>
<p>A:	Sorry.</p>
<p>Q:	No, no it’s good to know.  </p>
<p>A:	Well I guess the facts are the facts.  </p>
<p>Q:	But tell me, what was it that you were thinking?</p>
<p>A:	Just when you see the actual statistics, a person that might have considered going forward without a prenatal diagnosis or a pre-genetic diagnosis, I would think that this would discourage them from going forward because of the, let’s say for example, stating the fact that a child can get cancer anyway, even if you’re able to eliminate it.  There were a couple of other things that came up that-but these are the facts, there’s nothing you can really do about it.  And again I’m coming in here with a preconceived opinion about how I would move forward in this situation.</p>
<p>Q:	Well that’s what we want to hear.</p>
<p>A:	But again, seeing this maybe my opinion is influenced by my preconceived opinion, but it just seems like even a person coming in wanting to do pre-genetic testing or prenatal testing would not think it’s as great a thing to do by seeing this presentation.</p>
<p>Q:	Okay so what were the things that stood out to you?</p>
<p>A:	I have to like go through it again basically. </p>
<p>Q:	Which one do you want to talk about first?</p>
<p>A:	Let’s go from the beginning.  </p>
<p>Q:	So prenatal diagnosis which uses amniocentesis and chorionic villi sampling where they remove a piece of tissue or some fluid.  These were the issues we talked about.  </p>
<p>A:	So this one wouldn’t throw me off.  </p></content>

   <content size="1990"><p>So when you think about sharing this information, you had said that your genetic counselor mentioned something about this during your genetic counseling session.  Did it register with you?  One of our aims of this study is to try to figure out how genetic counselors should be talking about this, if they should be talking about this, when kind of to people as they come through the genetic testing process.  So what’s your take on that? What do you think? </p>
<p>A:	I didn’t have a problem with her bringing it up, I thought it was just an interesting point.  Again, me hearing that I was BRCA positive wasn’t tragic.  Me leaning that I had to do a surgery was not tragic, it was making the right decision that was most important to me.  I think that for some people, I think for most people it’s probably very different.  It’s a tragic thing and it’s lot to digest at night.  I don’t think it’s a bad idea to slip that in while you’re letting a person know so they remember to ask about it again later.  </p>
<p>Q:	So planting a seed is good?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah and I definitely gave it consideration.  And I appreciated the fact that it’s out there and that somebody’s thinking about it in those terms.  But God there’s so many illnesses in this world that we would love to weed out but where does it end?  Even now I tell people I did this because my mother had breast cancer and next week I’m having my colon removed.  </p>
<p>Q:	Is that something you worry about, colon cancer?</p>
<p>A:	No.  But I’m saying, I didn’t really worry about breast cancer either.  It was more of a logical decision, like I would be stupid not to do this.  All the signs are there.  Of course I’m going to get screened for colon cancer, but like how many body parts do you have to remove before you feel like you’re safe?  How many diseases are you going to weed out of your embryo before you’re going to feel like you’re safe?  So where’s it going to stop?</p></content>

<p>A:	Yeah there was like a nice amount of arguing, mainly over financial matters, a little over my brother and his grades and his behavior.  But we were young and I was a worrier.

They went off to college or my brother went to live in Queens so I was home with the younger ones and I asked my mother if she was sick and she said yes do you know where I’m sick?  And I pointed to my breast, this is what I remember.  And for me the hardest part was not knowing, like do you have cancer or don’t you have cancer.  And once I knew she had it well we’ll get through this.  Like I always believed-I never believed that she was going to die.  </p></content>

So I think I was probably very depressed because I would cry every day in class and I threw up the first day of school and I insisted it was because I didn’t like the school.  No, it has nothing to do with mommy going away, I know mommy’s going to be fine, it’s the school, I can’t take the school.  It ended up by November I loved the school and I really flourished there.  I did better than ever.  I didn’t do as well in elementary school, I was very ADD, I had a lot on my mind.  And in high school I was able to kind of focus on work plus cook for my siblings, take care of them, run the household and I loved it. </p>

Once he was in hospice, like once he was not coherent it was so painful to see him leaving that I wanted him to just go.  You know?  Probably the same with my mother, once she came back and wasn’t herself, I just wanted her to be in the hospital.  I guess it’s what they’d call abandonment issues, I don’t know.

   <content size="1559"><p>So my father, when the doctors came in, that Saturday that we were there together, over Thanksgiving, they said there’s nothing more that we can do.  I turned to him and said don’t worry I’m sure there’s some experimental treatments we can find.  And he turned to me and said you know what-for the first time after three years of being told this treatment stopped working and he said what else is in arsenal?  He’s like maybe leaving this world’s not going to be so bad.  Maybe it will be like when I was born, I’m sure I didn’t want to come into this world and it was fine.  And that was like the first time I’d heard him actually say I’m ready to go.  And they brought him home on a Thursday, the ambulance brought him back from Sloan-Kettering, and I walked in to see him laying in his bed and there was like classical music playing and I fell apart.  The hospice nurse was like oh is this her first time seeing you in a few years?  And they’re like no we don’t know what’s wrong with her, my siblings didn’t know what was wrong with me.  And of course my little sister was in college that day and my older siblings wanted to go home.  I’m like please don’t leave me, please don’t leave me, please wait for Rifkie to get home.  And they called for the little sister to come home and she’s like I just have one more class that I have to take care of.  That’s just the way she is, her head is in the sand.  So just saying goodbye was very, very hard.  Anyway, that doesn’t have anything to do with this study.  </p></content>

<p>A:	Maybe it’s because they fought a lot?  Maybe it’s because to me they just weren’t happy.  Maybe I’m not capable of a happy marriage.  The cancer doesn’t play as much into it as their interpersonal relationship.</p></content>

So my sister looked at that and said isn’t my mother stupid, could you believe she didn’t have her double mastectomy?  If she would have been better at screening or if she would have done what she was supposed to do she would never have died.  And she says the same thing about my father.  And my response has always been, even before this who thing came up, how far do you think, how much control do you think God has in these situations?  If she didn’t die of this she would have died of something else.  That’s just how I believe it.  My mother’s life wasn’t cut off at 42 because she wasn’t careful.</p></content>

I’m like, but oh the day before that my other doctor was like just do the surgery, I’m telling you, whatever helps you sleep at night, whatever helps you sleep at night.  So I texted my husband in the morning, the gynecologist said we should just have a baby.  And then later that evening I was like I spoke to the rabbi and he said we should just do the surgery.</p></content>

   <content size="1030"><p>all of a sudden I felt like the control was taken away from me and I think that might have been what it was.  One woman said to me you should just do the surgery now because you’re a girl who likes to be, like a mover and a shaker and you don’t want someone to put you on a timeline.  And then after the rabbi said it everything kind of fell into place.  I guess it would be difficult.  Because nobody said have all your kids and then do this.  They said have one kid and then do this six months after breastfeeding.  So would I want to start looking for someone to take care of my new child while I can’t carry it for four weeks?  Would I feel guilty that I breastfed the first one and not the second one?  All these things which by the way I spoke to another woman who has one child and she’s considering do this and she says I feel guilty that I won’t be able to breastfeed my other children.  I was like that’s so funny because I thought I might feel that way.  There’s just a lot of things to consider.  </p></content>

   <content size="852"><p>my sister is a very thinking person.  She read the reports, the way she interpreted it is the doctors recommended my mother do a double mastectomy and my mother wanted to go further with the treatments to shrink the cell down.  So my sister looked at that and said isn’t my mother stupid, could you believe she didn’t have her double mastectomy?  If she would have been better at screening or if she would have done what she was supposed to do she would never have died.  And she says the same thing about my father.  And my response has always been, even before this who thing came up, how far do you think, how much control do you think God has in these situations?  If she didn’t die of this she would have died of something else.  That’s just how I believe it.  My mother’s life wasn’t cut off at 42 because she wasn’t careful.</p></content>

   <content size="436"><p>That’s what I believe, that’s when her time was up.  You can’t look back and say she should have done this and she should have done that because even my sister could look back and say I should have looked at the size of my mother’s tumor and figured out when it might have started to develop.  Because technically a tumor that size could have started eight years prior which means my sister should have done this at 29.  </p></content>

   <content size="959"><p>Yeah.  And if she would have done this at 29 she wouldn’t have had three of her children until, she wouldn’t have been able to breast feed three of her children.  And now that she decided that 34 was the age, she not only has to undergo chemo, by recommendation of the doctor she’s having both of her ovaries out at the age of 35.  So she’s done having kids.  Again, as a person who believes-even when I first met with the genetic counselor and she was sitting with the oncologist in the room, I don’t remember his name.  My husband and I were at that point, I was 29, this was a few months ago, I had just turned 29 and we were starting to talk about having a family and there was the question of if I am positive I’ll have a kid quickly.  And then we’ll do the surgery and we’ll take it from there.  If I’m not positive well then there’s nothing to worry about except maybe I will worry, maybe I’ll want to do the surgery anyway</p></content>

   <content size="579"><p>She’s not.  There’s a younger one.  So the 25 year old she has one child and she had another on the way while all this was going down and she thought that my sister’s approach was very radical.  And even after finding the cancer my little sister still maintained the position that it was a radical procedure.  But when she saw me making the decision to go through with it she decided that that’s what she was going to do also.  So she’s not there yet, she’s only 25, and the way we understand it is as you get closer to 30 is when your risks start to increase.</p></content>

Not because I was afraid of doing surgery and not because I was afraid of getting cancer, but because I felt like I had to make a decision: should I make a baby today?  Or should I do this and push it off?  Am I being a chicken?  Am I chickening out of having a family?  What’s my problem?  There were a lot of things going on in my life at that point.

<p>A:	She’s like I think that’s a little crazy and I was surprised.  I was just going from doctor to doctor, breast surgeon to oncologist to plastic surgeon just to hear their opinion.  I basically wanted someone to tell me what to do.  Should I have a kid first or should I do the surgery first?  Should I have the opportunity to breastfeed a child or should I-it did not help to hear, oh you know some people can’t breastfeed anyway.  That didn’t help to hear because I didn’t think that would be my problem.  It actually kind of offended me when a doctor said to me, you know it’s not all it’s cracked up to be.

<p>Q:	Is this your family rabbi?</p>
<p>A:	You know, because I don’t have parents and because all of us kids kind of went off on our own, he’s not a family rabbi.  He’s somebody that I knew, my friend’s uncle, he’s from my hometown and I always trusted him to be a very intelligent man.  He knew my father, he knew my mother, he knew my grandfather.  And it was my friend who said why don’t you speak to my uncle.  He called me which was really sweet and he told me that when it comes to matters of life and death, you don’t take chances.  If having cancer, if developing that first cell is going to put you at risk because it’s such an aggressive form of cancer that the rest of your life you’re going to have to worry about getting it again, and the only thing holding you back from preventing that is breastfeeding, I really suggest you do this.  And I also think that once you do it your anxiety levels are going to go down.  I knew your parents, I knew what they went through, maybe this is a way of kind of removing yourself from that past.  So that’s when I made the decision to go forward with it.  </p></content>

   <content size="1039"><p>A:	Briefly, yeah.  I think it was during genetic counseling she may have said how they have the ability to test the embryos to find out if they’re gene carriers or not.  But then it was kind of like just, um, breezed over or whatever.  And then I think, I don’t remember, I think maybe my IVF woman who did that said that there’s technologies out there now.  But she didn’t specifically say about the BRCA gene, just that there’s technology out there where you can specifically test each embryo for different genetic things, but nothing specific so to speak.</p>
<p>Q:	So she was just giving you that general idea?</p>
<p>A:	Overview. </p>
<p>Q:	But did she take a history of the kinds of risks-?</p>
<p>A:	Well she knew why I was there.  She knew my history.</p>
<p>Q:	Where did you do your testing?  Sorry, I mean the IVF.</p>
<p>A:	St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Q:	And that’s where you did both your first treatment as well as your IVF treatment?</p>

   <content size="952"><p>A:	Um, yeah I think maybe it should be presented during genetic counseling because then usually you’re there with your husband, your significant other or somebody else.  Where you’d be able to explain it thoroughly to both parties involved and the other thing though is it’s got to be in a scenario, too, where you’re in that stage of all right so you’ll know you already have the gene but it could be a discussion that happens where you have the gene but it may not be diagnosed with cancer.  But if you are diagnosed then this discussion needs to happen really early on in your treatment because the options.</p>
<p>Q:	In your case, in your sister’s case?</p>
<p>A:	Right.  Because with, right.  So it’s kind of um, but I don’t know how you would be able to identify what-so you kind of have different scenarios then.  So somehow you need, once you’re diagnosed genetics has to get into that picture pretty early on though.</p></content>

   <content size="1200"><p>A:	But then again I don’t think this is too much though to give at that initial thing about deciding you’re just going to have the blood test.  Yeah it shouldn’t be, I don’t think it should be brought up at that initial, just deciding if you want the gene testing or not.  This needs to be discussed after you have those results.</p>
<p>Q:	Once you know.  </p>
<p>A:	Exactly.</p>
<p>Q:	And do you think it should be discussed with everybody or only people who let’s say express they are planning on having kids or do you have any thoughts about that?</p>
<p>A:	[pause] I think it should be expressed at some level to everybody but obviously if they have no interest in childbearing then you don’t need to go in depth about it.  So maybe the intro question would be like do you plan on childbearing at some point?  Then these are things to consider.</p>
<p>Q:	So you can explore that a bit.  I mean one of the questions that I think to manage in terms of presenting the information is that it’s a lot of information.</p>
<p>A:	It is or it can be.</p>
<p>Q:	Or it can be to take in.</p>
<p>A:	That’s why I said not until after you know that you’re genetically positive.</p></content>

   <content size="500"><p>Then once you get your results and you return for obviously if you’re positive they’re going to discuss with you surveillance techniques, your options.  Just because you have the gene some people go and do everything, they get rid of their ovaries, they get rid of their boobs, just because they don’t want to face that.  So I think at that point is when really everything should be laid out.  </p>
<p>Q:	And this would be a good place to present that?</p>
<p>A:	To present that, yeah.</p></content>

   <content size="980"><p>Was that much enough information, too much information?</p>
<p>A:	No, I think that that was enough and very thorough.  But for some people they may not be ready for all that information. </p>
<p>Q:	So that might be too much?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah maybe too much for them.  But, well you can see what kind of person I am and how I-so it was fine with me but I can see how some people would be like what, very affected in a different way by it.  So I think that’s why you need to first explore the whole kid thing and then you know briefly mention about it but then really get into the heart of it or the details with a couple or that’s seriously, but that’s hard to lead up to.  It’s just tough.</p>
<p>Q:	But try to gauge.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.</p>
<p>Q:	Check it out if people are ready for it and both based on where they’re at in terms of the information that they’re getting but also in terms of childbearing. </p>

   <content size="590"><p>Q:	Based on your own experience with IVF, because PGD requires IVF are there-here we spent more time probably talking about, well, you have to talk about IVF to talk about PGD, but do you think there are things people should know about IVF having been through at least part of it, I guess you’ve only been through the first part of it.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah there’s things they should know but that’s all going to come from whoever they choose to be their fertility doctor.  They go in depth about all that and they actually have a class but it’s all about the IVF cycle and stuff.</p></content>

So shortly after she found out I decided to get tested and I believe that was in ’05 or ’06 when I found out and I had the testing done and sure enough I got the phone call, you’re BRCA-1 positive.  </p></content>

   <content size="682"><p>Q:	Did your physicians make any recommendations at the time either way to do that?  </p>
<p>A:	No.  They said it was up to me.  You know and I was really my own advocate to tell you the truth.  It was input from other doctors here and that pretty much like what are you thinking?  You don’t really have a choice, this is pretty much laid the facts out in your face and said look this is an aggressive form of cancer, this is your-and I’m like do what you’ve got to do.  So once I finished chemo I had to wait a few, a certain amount of weeks or months for my system I guess to get back and then I, at Sloan Kettering I had my bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction. </p></content>

So I think it’s great that there’s research and things that people are doing to learn more about this gene as far as treatment and research and stuff.  I’m open to any, it’s great to learn, it’s education, it’s nice to know that there’s things out there like this and stuff.  I’m all for it, so.  </p></content>

But, well you can see what kind of person I am and how I-so it was fine with me but I can see how some people would be like what, very affected in a different way by it.  So I think that’s why you need to first explore the whole kid thing and then you know briefly mention about it but then really get into the heart of it or the details with a couple or that’s seriously, but that’s hard to lead up to.

   <content size="594"><p>before you decide to have this genetic testing, I guess that should be the basic, this is, just lay out flat the basics about breast cancer and ovarian cancer and the risks or whatever.  Then once you get your results and you return for obviously if you’re positive they’re going to discuss with you surveillance techniques, your options.  Just because you have the gene some people go and do everything, they get rid of their ovaries, they get rid of their boobs, just because they don’t want to face that.

<p>Q:	That was actually going to be one of my questions.</p>
<p>A:	But then again I don’t think this is too much though to give at that initial thing about deciding you’re just going to have the blood test.  Yeah it shouldn’t be, I don’t think it should be brought up at that initial, just deciding if you want the gene testing or not.  This needs to be discussed after you have those results.</p></content>

<p>Q:	How did you guys, did you talk to anyone about that?</p>
<p>A:	No, just and my husband, we made our own decision, yeah.  And that’s another spot me and my sister differed big time because she opted not to do any of that based on their own beliefs and stuff.</p>
<p>Q:	You’re Catholic or your sister’s Catholic?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah Catholic as well.  So we differed big time on that, but now she’s kicking herself in the butt. </p>
<p>Q:	She wants to have kids?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  She’s having a hell of a time, a lot of issues.</p>
<p>Q:	Is that why she took herself off of the Tamoxifen?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  It’s hard, I mean she’s been the one who’s wanted kids for years now and would be an awesome mom and she’s just been through hell and over and now she’s kind of second guessing the whole could have, should have, would have, but you can’t change things.</p>
<p>Q:	Is that hard for you since you did do it or do you guys talk about that?</p>
<p>A:	We don’t talk a lot, actually me and her are really close, me and her talk about it, but if her husband knew like we discussed and stuff it wouldn’t be okay.  She uses me as an outlet, I mean we have so much to relate to through everything  we’ve been through and stuff, it’s good we can talk to each other but like I said they are a couple, me and my husband are a couple and we have very different views and things, different from them.</p>
<p>Q:	So in her experience it was mostly her religious views that kept her from pursuing that?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>Q:	And her husband’s as well?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  </p>
<p>Q:	Maybe more so her husband’s it sounds like?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  </p>
<p>Q:	We don’t have to talk about that.  </p>
<p>A:	Right, we don’t know.  </p>
<p>Q:	Well that’s very hard to be going through.</p>

   <content size="756"><p>A:	As far as that issue stands I wouldn’t want to know and that would be a decision when the child got old enough I would explain to them our history and let them decide on going through the genetic testing that I went through to determine.  Obviously I would make them aware of it and do the surveillance because all those options would still be available to them it would just be a matter if genetically they want to know or not.

Where you’d be able to explain it thoroughly to both parties involved and the other thing though is it’s got to be in a scenario, too, where you’re in that stage of all right so you’ll know you already have the gene but it could be a discussion that happens where you have the gene but it may not be diagnosed with cancer.  But if you are diagnosed then this discussion needs to happen really early on in your treatment because the options.</p></content>

<p>A:	Well once I was informed that I was a carrier they brought us in for like a debriefing or something and at that point the counselor and then the doctor came in as well and it was the first time we had heard of this option but we-it was really my husband more than me that was just like jumped all over it.  I don’t know, because it wasn’t stressed by the doctor so much to me I don’t know that I would have put that much weight on it.  So it was really my husband’s interest and then we sought more information.  </p></content>

   <content size="940"><p>Q:	So you guys asked the genetic counselor here about testing your daughter?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah. </p>
<p>Q:	How did that come up, like in your counseling session when you found out?</p>
<p>A:	Yes.  When we found out and we were talking about PGD and then you know we realized we have a daughter and we didn’t know about this, can we test her?  And they said we don’t do it at such a young age.</p>
<p>Q:	Was that hard to hear?</p>
<p>A:	No, it makes sense.  It does make sense to me.  I don’t know, yeah it makes sense but at the same time it’s sort of, like I understand the reasoning behind it but at the same time it seems that it’s our child and our life.  If we want to know, we should be able to know.  I mean it’s not putting anyone’s health in jeopardy.  So I don’t know maybe, the more I think about it maybe it’s, I feel like it’s sort of crossing a line of like-like it’s an arbitrary rule, sort of.</p></content>

   <content size="1218"><p>Q:	Did you, what was it like being the first in the family to do that?  Was that hard?</p>
<p>A:	It wasn’t.  I don’t know, it’s just sort of my personality, I wasn’t, I’m not that emotional.  So it hasn’t, I just see it more as if like there’s a problem then I wanted to be sure I was on top of it.  And so to me I just wanted to be sure to communicate that to them so that they had as much information as they could have.  So it wasn’t, it really wasn’t that hard for me, I mean it was harder for me that my sister has the mutation than that I do.  She’s more upset about it.  So that to me is more difficult.  But at the same time she wouldn’t have tested without me, so I’m glad that she now knows because she is taking action.  </p>
<p>Q:	Is she older or younger?</p>
<p>A:	She’s two years older.</p>
<p>Q:	And so you said you kind of knew all along and you felt that you had it.  Were you surprised when you got the test results?</p>
<p>A:	I wasn’t, I really wasn’t.  I sort of feel that even if I didn’t have the mutation that I would still assume that I was going to get breast cancer at some point.  I don’t know I just assume, just because of my family history.  </p></content>

   <content size="869"><p>Q:	And have your thoughts or feelings about BRCA changed over time or has it been-you said you sort of, you’re not somebody who’s that emotional?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah well I mean it hasn’t, I learned more about it after I knew I had it.  So it hasn’t changed, it’s certainly more serious than I thought it was.  I always knew it heightened my risk of developing those cancers but I didn’t realize to what degree necessarily.  Within a little bit, I mean it was pretty close to what I thought but it was more-and I appreciated the doctor who came in who was very clear and was just straightforward and was saying basically you’re going to get breast cancer.  That’s it.  The longer you live, you’re going to get it.  So it just made us sort of really consider, you know, like prophylactic mastectomy and things like that I otherwise wouldn’t have. </p></content>

   <content size="3621"><p>Q:	How many cycles have you guys attempted and what’s it been like?</p>
<p>A:	We’ve done, let’s see, we’ve done two full cycles and one frozen cycle.  So the problem was the first time we did it we really did not want twins so we only implanted one embryo, or transferred one and it didn’t work.  And then I had two frozen ones left over so we did that and it didn’t work.  </p>
<p>Q:	So that was from the first round of the embryos?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, so I ended up with three from that first cycle.</p>
<p>Q:	That were BRCA free?</p>
<p>A:	That were BRCA free.  And then we started over again and I said you know I want you to make sure I have tons of embryos so we can freeze a lot and just I don’t want to go through this again.  It ended up that we had eight that went for genetic testing and only two came back BRCA free, which was like very frustrating because I thought, the stats are 50% but not in that case.  So I only ended up with two so we couldn’t freeze any because we transferred both of them and I actually was pregnant with twins and then ended up miscarrying both of them.</p>
<p>Q:	When was that?</p>
<p>A:	A couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>Q:	I’m sorry about that.</p>
<p>A:	So now we have to wait a couple of months to try again. </p>
<p>Q:	Do you have a set number of cycles that you want to try?  Do you have a limit?</p>
<p>A:	I don’t know.  I mean we’ll probably try a couple of more cycles.  I don’t know if we would try more than that.  I really would like to have some frozen, something to freeze.  But I mean we’ll probably try a couple more times.  </p>
<p>Q:	So is this, are you planning to have hopefully another pregnancy but then to have two children?  You said you didn’t want to have twins or did you not specifically want to have twins?</p>
<p>A:	Right, no I’d love to have like four kids, at this rate I don’t know if it’s going to happen.  Maybe if I have twins I’d only need one more, which would be the positive of twins. [laughs]  But no, I’d like to have more.</p>
<p>Q:	Did your views about that, about whether or not you would have twins change in the course-</p>
<p>A:	A little bit, yeah.  I mean I did not want them at first and now it’s sort of I’d just be psyched to be pregnant.  </p>
<p>Q:	So you have to wait a little bit before you can do another cycle, which you’re going to do.</p>
<p>A:	Right.</p>
<p>Q:	What’s it been like to do the cycles?  Has it been hard or have you sort of-</p>
<p>A:	Actually the hardest is right now not doing anything.  I mean when I’m physically doing something to get to where I want to be it’s much easier for me.  I mean it’s not pleasant but I’m going towards something that’s the most important thing to me right now so I’m really willing to do whatever I have to.  You know it’s pretty amazing the facility over there and how efficient everything is and you know everyone’s just very knowledgeable so it hasn’t been, it’s been fine.</p>
<p>Q:	I know they have support services there and everything like that.  Have you used any of that?</p>
<p>A:	I haven’t.  But it’s really just seeing the sheer number of women that are there every morning and just, you know it’s like a factory, it’s not like a bad place to be, I didn’t mean to imply that.  But it’s really just very, people are there for a reason and they’re in and out and the majority people it looks like work and it’s just they make sure that it’s just a small part of your day?</p>

<p>A:	Yeah my recollection was that we spent more time on like the mastectomy then as sort of reaction to the diagnosis, I don’t know if it’s called a diagnosis, but to the diagnosis.  And so he said and there are other, if you want to have more kids there are options like-I don’t know, maybe it was just, it felt like he mentioned it quickly because I had never heard of it so I felt like there wasn’t a ton of information.  And maybe he would have spoken about it more even if my husband hadn’t sort of asked him a lot of questions.

   <content size="4618"><p>Q:	So how did you end up deciding whether or not to do the PGD yourself? </p>
<p>A:	Let’s see.  I think that I wanted to get more information about it and my husband really just wanted to do it without question.  </p>
<p>Q:	Does he have cancer in his family?</p>
<p>A:	No.  He just, he was much more upset about me having BRCA than I was and he just doesn’t, he can’t handle it.  He’s just sort of, if there’s not something he can control it kind of freaks him out so he just wanted, he just said  I don’t understand morally how we can go forward having a child knowing that we could pass along this deadly thing to them when we can prevent it.  I just don’t understand how that decision-and he has very strong opinions and he’s very persuasive.  And I agree with him, I mean I certainly if it could have been prevented and my mom had the gene, all of our lives could be very different right now.  So to have that knowledge and to do nothing about with the knowledge is just ultimately something we couldn’t do.  So it was, he definitely like, initially was pushing me in one direction but then ultimately obviously I made the decision, but I don’t know that I would have considered it as carefully or as seriously if he wasn’t there to really, you know, push it along.</p>
<p>Q:	What was your initial reaction when you just heard that PGD existed?  Did you think ah that’s something I’d want to do or not quite yet?</p>
<p>A:	I don’t know, I was sort of, I mean the fact that I was sort of under the feeling that you know there are a lot of issues out there and fertility is not one that we have.  We have no problem there so why subject myself and ourselves to this process that, um, all I know is that it doesn’t work all the time and that it’s difficult.  So I was thinking about that, I was thinking how many people who choose not to do PGD feel, thinking that in 30 years from now who knows what medicine’s going to be like, you know? That combined with, so even if our child does have it maybe it won’t be a problem.  Or you know also the feeling that who knows really the risks of doing PGD and it is unnatural and I’m totally a believer in modern medicine but it’s scary.  I mean that is very unnatural to do it so, you know, artificially.  So that still is a concern to me, like I don’t know really there could be damage to the embryos, there could be risks we don’t know about, in addition to the boost in estrogen that I am receiving through the process.  So there are all these things to consider but ultimately the health of my child was the thing that won out in the end.  </p>
<p>Q:	Did you guys talk about the sort of weighing those issues?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah certainly and especially when we’ve done it a few times and it hasn’t worked, we keep coming back to like well what about the fact that I keep this estrogen, that’s been a concern.  And our doctors say they wouldn’t, I mean they don’t know for certain but they don’t think that it’s a problem.  </p>
<p>Q:	But it’s been in the back of your mind it sounds like?</p>
<p>A:	Well yeah it’s kind of ironic that the reason we’re doing it is for breast cancer yet in order to do it I need more estrogen.  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah, that’s scary.  So did you guys have any fertility problems, or you pursued PGD for PGD?</p>
<p>A:	Right, yes exactly.  No we haven’t had any fertility problems with our first daughter we didn’t, we only have one daughter, but we had no problems.  </p>
<p>Q:	So you were sort of on the fence and he was it sounds like interested and you decided you’d at least go for a consultation and then where did it go from there then?</p>
<p>A:	So after our consultation, I mean basically right then and there we said okay yeah we want to do it, um, and you know it’s always sort of you want an answer and you want someone to tell you something like absolutely.  The questions that we had can’t really necessarily be answered, like is this definitely going to work or like is the baby definitely not going to have the mutation, all these things.  And it was sort of like, would there be damage to the embryo through PGD and everyone was sort of like well we don’t think that, well studies have shown that no, it’s not really a risk or whatever.  And so it was kind of, in that way it’s frustrating but I guess that’s how medicine goes.  </p>
<p>Q:	You would have liked more absolutes, like yes we know this.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, which anyone would with any situation.  But we did decide though right then and there that we wanted to try it. </p></content>

   <content size="2086"><p>Q:	One of the things, do you have, we’ve talked to people about what they feel for themselves versus what they feel should be available in general.  Do you feel like prenatal diagnosis is something that should be available at all for BRCA, for other people even or does it feel like something that when they say you can do various prenatal tests, should that be on the list of things? </p>
<p>A:	Yeah I mean I don’t, wouldn’t go so far as to say that I’m morally against it I just wouldn’t do it.  You know, I think that everyone has different reasons to do different things and I think that’s fine.  It is something that’s very serious and obviously I’m trying to eliminate from my future generations.  But it’s just to me not worth terminating a pregnancy over.  It sounds strange now that I’m saying it, since I’m going to great lengths to, you know, make sure that it doesn’t happen.  But I don’t know.</p>
<p>Q:	But it feels different?</p>
<p>A:	It does, yeah.  </p>
<p>Q:	And does your partner feel the same way or have not talked about prenatal diagnosis at all?</p>
<p>A:	Um, we haven’t really spoken about it but I don’t, well actually that’s not true, we did speak about it and it was a very quick conversation, he agreed.  Because I said the options are basically we could do it this way or we could get pregnant naturally and do an amnio or CVS and he said no, we would never terminate the pregnancy.</p>
<p>Q:	And was that actually mentioned as an option, that you could get pregnant and do the screening then or did you think that yourself?  We’re interested in what information is even out there actually for people.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah I think it was mentioned all along first with the initial genetic counselor and then with the doctor at Cornell also, and also my ob/gyn, like everyone has said those are the two options.  </p>
<p>Q:	That is you didn’t want to do PGD you could do prenatal diagnosis.  Okay so it actually is being talked about as a potential option. </p>

   <content size="480"><p>Yeah I mean I think that one of the things that my husband and I didn’t know at all was just the invasiveness or just how difficult IVF was because we have a daughter but we conceived her naturally so we’ve never had experience with IVF before.

I think we over educated ourselves on how it relates to BRCA and how it reduces the risk and everything, but just the actual process of IVF was a shock certainly.</p></content>

   <content size="2279"><p>Q:	Can I ask where you-</p>
<p>A:	I did it at Cornell.  </p>
<p>Q:	Okay.  And did you, was it a surprise to you in the process itself or surprised when you first learned about it?  Was it the going through it that was a surprise for you?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah well when we went to the training session of like okay this is what you do and do these three shots a night and you come in for blood tests every morning.  And I think that probably every hospital does it a little bit differently but-and the progesterone after it and then it was just like we sort of thought it was three weeks of intense shots and things and then it was over and we weren’t aware of the progesterone afterwards and all these things.  So it was just, it didn’t dissuade us but it was sort of just surprising that that part of it was never really discussed with us, with our genetic counselor.</p>
<p>Q:	That you may have to do this multiple times, that there would be things after this.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah and I also don’t think that our genetic counselor really stressed the option of PGD.  We sort of like honed in on it, we didn’t know about it but we sort of said wait go back, what did you say, there’s an option to do what?  And I feel like sort of like, the doctor sort of glanced over it, mentioned it certainly but didn’t stress it, I guess.</p>
<p>Q:	So maybe I’ll jump into my PGD questions and ask you some of my other questions later since we’re talking about it.  So what made you decide to seek PGD in the beginning?  Were you seeking-</p>
<p>A:	Well once I was informed that I was a carrier they brought us in for like a debriefing or something and at that point the counselor and then the doctor came in as well and it was the first time we had heard of this option but we-it was really my husband more than me that was just like jumped all over it.  I don’t know, because it wasn’t stressed by the doctor so much to me I don’t know that I would have put that much weight on it.  So it was really my husband’s interest and then we sought more information.  </p>
<p>Q:	And just to clarify, when you were saying it wasn’t emphasized that much you mean in your BRCA counseling?</p>
<p>A:	Exactly.</p>
<p>Q:	Not at your genetic counseling?</p>
<p>A:	Right.</p></content>

   <content size="2902"><p>A:	Yeah I mean I do think, one thing that I’ve found is once we decided, we sort of said let’s try PGD and then if it doesn’t work we always know that don’t need it we could just have another baby.  But now that I’m in it, I’m sort of like I can’t, it’s much harder now not to do it than it would have been if we’d never started to begin with because it’s sort of like now we’ve made our decision to try PGD and the reasons are the same so why would we ever stop trying PGD, you know?  And that actually emotionally has been the only thing that’s been like tugging me both ways.  It’s sort of like I really want to have another baby and it hasn’t been, I mean I guess it hasn’t been that long considering the average length it takes people to get pregnant, but just because it was so easy for us the first time it seems like a very, very long time.  Going through it and each time it didn’t work I was sort of always like it’s okay I can stop this anytime and we can just do it naturally.  But then each time it happens I decide not to stop trying that way so it’s kind of like now we’re caught in this thing where we believe in it obviously and that’s why we’re doing it but it’s sort of that’s like a false, or my sort of false comfort that I can stop it.  </p>
<p>Q:	And you sort of are coming to realize that you don’t feel you can stop it.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.</p>
<p>Q:	That’s important to know.  Do you think there would have been any difference in terms of your decision if somebody said you might have to go through this, it might take a few years or  you might have to go through several cycles?</p>
<p>A:	Well I don’t, because we were very cocky about it which is why we transferred only one embryo the first time.  We were like we had no problems, like all these statistics don’t apply to us, I mean seriously we kept saying that to each other.  They say this but that totally doesn’t apply to us.  And we were just, it was totally asinine and we were taught our lesson.</p>
<p>Q:	Did the doctor say well you really should consider these statistics or sort of let you know?</p>
<p>A:	She did, she did say that like well no, you are, the bulk of the statistics are based on people with infertility problems so you are at a slightly, in a better situation but she still recommends transferring two.  But we really, I mean the first time we did it we just didn’t take it that seriously.  I mean not in terms of going through everything but like after it was transferred I was like went from the hospital like directly out with my daughter out running around.  Like we did not, I just did not take it seriously enough in that way.  </p>
<p>Q:	It sounds like it would have been-even if they did give you that information at the time, you kind of had to go through it.</p>
<p>A:	Which they did, we just totally disregarded it.  </p></content>

   <content size="500"><p>Q:	So first I wanted to check in with you about your feelings about the presentation and just what was going on in your mind as I was presenting it.</p>
<p>A:	Um, I mean I don’t really have that much of an emotional feeling about this whole process anymore because I’ve sort of been living through it.  So I just found it, it confirmed everything I knew, and so I found it informative just in the way that I thought they were all important, it was very important and certainly relevant.  </p></content>

   <content size="2919"><p>Q:	Did you feel like you would have wanted more information at that point?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah I think that the reason you are in that session is to learn everything you can about how your life can be ultimately affected and what to do about it.  So yeah I certainly think that it’s important to get there.  </p>
<p>Q:	So I’m going to ask you a few questions about, let me jump ahead to those kinds of questions.  I mean one of the things we’re interested in is when people think this information should be presented, whether it should be presented when you get your diagnosis, generally not, it’s not a diagnosis, but when you learn your mutation status or even before that when you’re considering genetic testing or at some point later if it seems like that’s a lot of information to get.  Do you have a feeling of when you would want to know? Would you have wanted to know even before you got the testing or would you want to know only when you learned that-</p>
<p>A:	No I actually think that that would have been, if I were on the fence about getting the testing that probably would have pushed me over.  So I think, because I think a lot of people don’t understand why to get the testing, like there’s nothing you can do about it.  I think a lot of people think that, you know, like my mom just thought you know I don’t want you living with the stress of thinking every day you could have cancer.  There’s no reason to be under that increased stress, you’re already being followed closely and there’s nothing you can do about it.  But I personally, I think it would be helpful to know as early as possible.</p>
<p>Q:	So that might be another piece of information that may, if you were on the fence about testing, could have swayed-your sister who actually was on the fence may have swayed one way or the other, so to know earlier.  How much information would you want?  You were saying that you weren’t given that much information at the time.  Would you have wanted to know as much information as we provided, more information even?</p>
<p>A:	I don’t know if at that point, I mean I don’t know.  I think there was a lot of information given at that session and it was more, I think the point of it was more to sort of make sure that I knew about me personally and how to plan around the fact that I had the mutation, so I think that it’s just important to make sure that the patient understands like this is something that you can seek more information about.  I mean certainly some information so that the patient understands okay I know enough that I know I want more information about it.  But I don’t know, what you presented was a lot of information so I don’t know that all of that would be necessary.</p>
<p>Q:	So just enough to know that it existed and enough to know where you could go for more information kind of thing, the basics.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, right.  </p></content>

<p>A:	Yeah. </p>
<p>Q:	How did that come up, like in your counseling session when you found out?</p>
<p>A:	Yes.  When we found out and we were talking about PGD and then you know we realized we have a daughter and we didn’t know about this, can we test her?  And they said we don’t do it at such a young age.</p>
<p>Q:	Was that hard to hear?</p>
<p>A:	No, it makes sense.  It does make sense to me.  I don’t know, yeah it makes sense but at the same time it’s sort of, like I understand the reasoning behind it but at the same time it seems that it’s our child and our life.  If we want to know, we should be able to know.  I mean it’s not putting anyone’s health in jeopardy.

So if it’s something people want to find out about, then I guess it’s something that they could know and should know about as an option early on it just to me there’s so many other things that are kind of heavy, bigger or potentially bigger that I would want to know   about.  You know it’s hard because it’s just not something I would want to know, but whether people have the right to find out and do whatever they want with that information, I guess so, yeah.  If they want to either know or terminate or not implant or whatever feels right to them.</p></content>

   <content size="2801"><p>So I don’t think, I just don’t feel like it’s something necessary for people to know about screening for or just screen for at that stage.  It’s an option-if the technology’s out there do you not tell people that it’s out there?  I don’t think you should withhold the information but I guess at what point to you let people know that it exists?  </p>
<p>Q:	And you said you found out before you even-</p>
<p>A:	Before I was tested.  I think before I even decided to get tested.  Yeah I’m pretty sure that’s when it was. </p>
<p>Q:	So if people were to talk about these technologies, either PGD or prenatal diagnosis, do you think that was good timing even before you know or is it better to wait until you know your status?</p>
<p>A:	I guess that’s a good time because it’s like just information.  It’s like here’s everything we know right now, this is the type of screening you should go through, this is the type of surgeries you might need, this is available if you wanted to get pregnant and find out if the embryo was a carrier.</p>
<p>Q:	So if you tested positive these would be your options for yourself, these would be the other options, you can explore any of these if that’s the case versus what do you think it would have been like for you if you can-it’s a hypothetical question-knowing when you found out you got your results would that have been too much information?</p>
<p>A:	I think it would have been too much information.  And the same way, I don’t think I would have wanted to know when I went to the genetic counselor, not just at Sloan Kettering with my OB/GYN, and they went through all the tests that I could do-well there were really two stages when I had tests: I had genetic testing before I ever got pregnant to test for a battery of Ashkenazi diseases.  I guess it could have been something then because if I was a carrier for one of those Ashkenazi diseases, and say my husband was a carrier as well, then I guess we would have done IVF.  And done kind of selective implantation based on that.  But I feel like the place for the BRCA information is probably best when you find out if you’re a carrier versus-because to me it’s kind of tied to the cancer side of things versus the baby side of things.  So I guess to me it would make most sense to find out when you sort of understand what your options are when you’re going to get tested to see if you’re a carrier, that these are the things that we’re learning about now, these are the things that are options, you can find out more information about, the same way that you can find out more about having a mastectomy, it wasn’t for me what I wanted to be finding out about then.  But it’s good to know that it’s a possibility or an option if it came to that.</p></content>

   <content size="912"><p>Q:	I’m hearing you felt like you were in a mental space to hear it more so when you were contemplating should I get this testing, what would it mean if I did than when you actually got your results.  </p>
<p>A:	Right.  Because it’s hard enough to kind of wrap your head around how that impacts you, let alone thinking how’s that going to impact my possibly unconceived child?  It’s just sort of too much information I think at that time.  And I would imagine, yeah, it’s just hard to wrap your head around.</p>
<p>Q:	It sounds like you’d rather hear of, if it’s got to be talked about better to have it talked about in the context of the BRCA decisions, the testing decisions, rather than the reproductive decisions in terms of the way you might approach other genetic testing that are about the potential child you might have, kind of thing.  </p>

   <content size="1405"><p>Q:	For now yes that’s what we’re interested in, yeah exactly, whether PGD for BRCA carriers should be talked about in the context of let’s say genetic counseling, in the context of screening that people are going, in the context of maybe appointments with OB/GYNs, should it even be talked about as an option for people who are carriers?</p>
<p>A:	[pause] I don’t know.  Because it feels so, um, it’s like too much information.  It’s just like oh my God I can’t even begin to imagine [pause].</p>
<p>Q:	It’s too much, like knowing the child’s status is too much information or knowing about the technology is too much information?  </p>
<p>A:	I think just knowing about the status is sort of too much information again because there’s nothing you can do about it.  So [pause] I don’t know, it’s giving people information is one thing but giving them information so they can make decisions is almost a different thing.  It’s like again, like finding out the sex, I think it’s great that people can find out the sex, I wanted to find out the sex and I could.  But would I, do I think it’s okay that people know the sex so that if they want a girl they can terminate if it’s a boy?  I don’t think that’s the right thing to do.  But that doesn’t mean that you should withhold the information just because I don’t think people should be making that decision.  </p></content>

<p>A:	If I had a daughter-I guess it would be different if I had a daughter or a son, but then again I don’t know what the differences are.  I know like roughly one man to every 200 women who has breast cancer-well, of people who have breast cancer one out of every 200 could be a man.  </p>
<p>Q:	Mm-hmm [yes]. </p>
<p>A:	I don’t know how good that number is, but that’s what I heard like years ago.  So-I don’t know how I would treat like a son.  Like, should he give himself breast exams?  Like, I don’t think so.  Are they supposed to?  </p>
<p>Q:	You know, I don’t know what they recommend for men who carry the BRCA-</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, that’s kind of like a gray area.  I don’t even know, I’d have to look into that.  But what I think now is I would focus more on like a daughter, you know, where it seems much more likely to occur, and I probably would just place more emphasis on, you know, when she’s coming of age, on like starting-you know, goes through puberty, starts going to a gynecologist and having that routine stuff done, I would place more emphasis on self breast exams and more awareness like for her health than  perhaps was placed on me at that age-which I, still, you know, I was guided well and everything, but I would just be like, “Look, take this more seriously,” like starting from, I don’t know how old, depending on how old she is.  </p></content>

Like I would drive home, okay-of course this information may change, but, yeah, I would just put more emphasis on it at an earlier age, like, “Watch your body, like be aware of what’s going on, give yourself breast exams and just, you know, go to the doctor regularly and talk to them about it.”  </p>

   <content size="2963"><p>Q:	Okay.  So I’m just going to ask you a few more questions about-well, actually, let me just follow up on one thing that you said.  So, if you knew you would share it with your child-was it important to you that you got to make the decision to get tested yourself or not-that’s the way it came about for you, but-</p>
<p>A:	What do you mean, I had a decision whether or not I want to go and get tested?</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah.  Or did you have a decision?  If you chose not to do it-</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, I was a little too old.  I mean, you know, what is my dad going to like force me to do something?  It’s like, you know, because he cares, you know, how can I argue?  Like, all right, you know, it’s one day-not even one day, it’s like a half a day.  So, yeah, it was good I had the decision to get tested, like, okay, do I want to know or do I not want to know?  But I don’t see that-do you mean like as far as my like potential child or potential [overlapping] is concerned that they were tested pre-birth-</p>
<p>Q:	Exactly.  For you that, you know, whether or not they got to make that choice, is that an important choice or not such an important choice?  </p>
<p>A:	Yeah, it’s definitely like, you know, a good choice, like it’s good to have a choice, do you want to know or do you not want to know, but, again, is someone going to hold that against their parent, “Oh, you violated my privacy because you tested me before I was born”?  I can’t see someone like actually personally or emotionally effecting them, oh, “Because you tested me in the womb,” like, “How dare you?”  I wouldn’t care.  It’s just like when the decision comes about you give it more credit, like, okay, I’m deciding to find out or not to find out.  </p>
<p>Q:	Mm-hmm [okay]. </p>
<p>A:	I still think it would be a good thing to do if you as a parent want to know-</p>
<p>Q:	Mm-hmm [okay]. </p>
<p>A:	Otherwise-well, I mean you’re just going to know for sure if you get that done while, you know, the child is like-while you’re pregnant.  But either way, as long as you know that your child is at risk you can just as easily, you know, urge them to get genetic testing at a certain age, and you don’t know until they reach that certain age, it’s really just what you’re content with I guess.  </p>
<p>Q:	Mm-hmm [okay].  Yeah, so you don’t think it would be sort of-if your parents had done this it doesn’t sound like you would feel like, “What?  You didn’t give me the chance to choose”-</p>
<p>A:	Absolutely not.  Like what, am I going to get mad about something I wasn’t even born yet?  Like I don’t care about what happened like a year ago, you know, I’m over it, like-yeah.  I don’t think there’s a problem with that.  That’d be weird, like-</p>

   <content size="1981"><p>Q:	So what was I guess your reaction when you found out?</p>
<p>A:	I was upset at first.  It took a little while to realize it’s not, like there’s nothing I have to do other than my screenings and that type of stuff but at this point with my age and everything else I just need to be careful that I could get breast cancer at an earlier age.  But that just means I need to be more diligent than some of my contemporaries to do the testing.  But it took a little while to get there.  At first I was just kind of upset by it and it was hard because at first you’re like “well now I’m going to get breast cancer and now I could get ovarian cancer.”  But now I realize, no, because the other thing’s the study-right after I got diagnosed was when a lot more of the articles came out that there’s not necessarily an increased, that not as many people are developing cancer because they’re positive.  Because at first when my aunt was diagnosed almost five years ago now, because everyone who was being tested was already a cancer patients they thought there was an automatic, like you’re positive, there’s a gene, you’re getting cancer.  But then now with more people being tested like myself and my sister and my cousin, they’re discovering well you can live with the gene and never develop cancer.  So that has made me feel better, too, about being positive is that I still have to do all the stuff that’s recommended but I could also still not develop cancer.  Now if anything I’m just hopefully, if I am going to develop cancer I’m going to catch it early instead of too late.  So that’s what I keep telling-and it just took a little time to get there.  My husband was with me the day we got the-we talked about it, I think we went to lunch afterwards and he was like “you know it’s not a death sentence, it’s nothing, it’s just something now you have to live with and you have to be good about your screenings&quot; and what not.  </p></content>

<p>Q:	Has that impacted your feelings about or any plans or ideas?</p>
<p>A:	No because I keep telling myself they’re smokers and they know it’s her and not him, like they both got tested.  Well that’s them and not that like I guess because I don’t want to be them I keep telling myself that’s them and if we have to go get tested, like we’ll know who’s the problem and what’s the problem hopefully so that we can know what we’re going to do. </p>
<p>Q:	Do you think it gave you a clear sense of what IVF could either, multiple attempts or things like that?</p>
<p>A:	In some aspects yeah. </p>
<p>Q:	Or sort of generally, like that they had unique circumstance?</p>
<p>A:	I don’t think theirs was unique, I think theirs was what you typically hear is that people have tried and some people are successful and some people aren’t.  I have other friends who have done implementations but that’s because they’re with a same sex partner so they’ve done an implementation because they have no other means to get pregnant.

And I think maybe more gynecologists-I mean I haven’t been to a fertility specialist so I don’t know what they’re talking about but I know from my own gynecologist’s office that I feel like if I were to bring this up to them they’d be like what are you talking about?  My own doctors don’t necessarily-in some aspects I have a better education about it than my own doctors, so if there’s a way to like get the medical profession, especially doctors like gynecologists that deal specifically with women of childbearing, that if they could be made more aware of, especially that they can test the embryos, so that they can tell a patient like myself who might not have access to this that “oh, you know, I heard about this” so when you go to the fertility specialist maybe you should ask the fertility specialist and here’s an article about it or whatever.  Because I know my own doctor’s office would be like, I really feel like if I were to say something to them they’d say I don’t know what you’re talking about.  But I mean the fertility specialist might be different because they’re, obviously my gynecologist is not the one doing the implantation obviously it’s the-but at the same time if I ask them to test the embryos, the fetus they might say to me, again, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”  Well I went-and again, I don’t know if there’s a way to better educate the medical profession so that it can come down to patients.</p></content>

So we never had her tested because we didn’t think she’d understand and then even if she was positive we thought she couldn’t handle that, that she was positive and she was carrier, but she wouldn’t be able to handle that my aunt was positive.

   <content size="1235"><p> my dad encouraged him to get tested that way his daughters didn’t have to do it if he came back negative because their mom has no history, their family has no history so there’s no reason so they got tested only because my dad was positive and they felt were better, even though it was their uncle they were better off being tested and knowing even if their dad-they wouldn’t have had to get tested obviously if their dad got tested but because he didn’t they’re like then we’re going to go ahead because our uncle’s positive. </p>
<p>Q:	Was that, was their any conflict or tension around his decision not to get tested?  Or did people accept that?</p>
<p>A:	My mom and dad tried to push him a lot to do so that my cousins wouldn’t have to go through it.  Not that it’s so terrible to go through but at the same time he’s older and he’s out of all the risk categories so he’s not going to find anything out that would affect him when both my cousins are in the risk categories.  So he-a little bit but at the same time when we told them that my dad was positive and they have a chance of being positive because it’s obviously in their family they both decided to take the initiative and be tested.  </p></content>

It’s like “oh I’m going to the breast surgeon” it’s like “oh okay.”  Like it’s not, none of us get on alert that something’s wrong, we all just know that it’s part of being positive and we both have to do these things. </p></content>

Where I think for her because she didn’t have any problems getting pregnant and that was, they could test her fetus to see if it was BRCA positive she might consider terminating it so that she knows she’s not putting that child at risk for future health complications.  I think that’s the difference, is that I have a concern about getting pregnant just in general whereas she’s had two kids with no problem, so I think it creates a different feeling.  </p></content>

Because at first when my aunt was diagnosed almost five years ago now, because everyone who was being tested was already a cancer patients they thought there was an automatic, like you’re positive, there’s a gene, you’re getting cancer.  But then now with more people being tested like myself and my sister and my cousin, they’re discovering well you can live with the gene and never develop cancer.  So that has made me feel better, too, about being positive is that I still have to do all the stuff that’s recommended but I could also still not develop cancer.  </p></content>

   <content size="928"><p>Q:	How close were you with your aunt while she was going through everything?</p>
<p>A:	Really close.  I mean at the very beginning my mom and dad were away so she kept calling my sister and I because my mom and her were extremely close.  And so she kept calling us because she was going in for surgery and our mom wasn’t here and she needed to talk to somebody.  Like she talked to her daughter but she needed more than that, so she kept calling me and my sister.  We would see her a lot over the last few years when she-but we were very close.  I mean I spoke to her more frequently than I saw her but I would speak to her on the phone and I would always ask her how she’s doing.  The end came very quickly.  It spread very fast at the end, it was only a few weeks.  But it was, I think it was better that way than a long suffering.  I mean she fought.  </p>

So as soon as she found out I was positive she was like “okay well now we have to do this, this, and this.”  So I went for my first breast MRI only a few weeks after and there was actually something in the film that they weren’t sure about and then the doctor said, this was all through my regular doctor, not even my gynocologist, just my primary care physician.  So then they sent me for a mammogram.  And my mom was like now we have to go see a breast surgeon, you need to see a breast surgeon immediately.  So she called ones that were actually recommended to us by Sloan and none of them could see me right away and that was making me anxious that nobody, only the radiologist had read the films and not like a breast surgeon.  And then she’s like “well let me call my own” and see if he’ll, because she’s had some cysts and things that-so she was like “let me call my breast surgeon and see if he can” and sure enough they could see me like the very next day.

   <content size="3527"><p>I go for the breast MRI once a year.  The breast surgeon doesn’t recommend the mammograms, he doesn’t, he feels just because I’m only 32 they’re kind of pointless right now.  But he reads my breast MRI and he does a breast exam, he personally likes to the exam twice a year.  I know it’s the recommendation is just two medical professionals and my own, my primary care physician actually will do the breast exam at my check up but the breast surgeon likes to do it himself and he actually, of all the doctors who have done breast exams I do prefer his breast exam over, I feel like he’s the most thorough.  So I do go to him twice a year for that. And I go to my gynecologist and I go even to the primary care physician-and that’s, my primary care physician is actually probably the one who’s most like overly zealous about being positive.  Like when I came back I think I was diagnosed in January and then I had an appointment with him just maybe the very beginning of February, it was like middle of January and then I saw him in February.  And I saw him and he was like, he was the one who was like now we have to do this and this and he likes to run the stupid ovarian cancer blood test.</p>
<p>Q:	Oh the CA125?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  And I keep telling him it’s not worth running it because it’s wholly inaccurate.  </p>
<p>Q:	Let me give you the paper.</p>
<p>A:	And he’s like no, we have to run it and even one time he ran it and it came back high twice so he’s like well “I want you to see the oncologist” so he sent me to the hematologist/oncologist and she’s like “why are you”-I’m like “because the doctor wanted it.”  And she’s like “okay I’m going to write a note that he doesn’t need to” because they were all in the same office, “I’m going to write a note that he doesn’t need to send you to me again” and the only thing that she was willing to do was write the prescription for the breast MRI but I was like “I don’t need you, I have my breast surgeon.”  So if anything my primary care physician is like over zealous about what he wants to do.  He likes to run the blood tests and I’m always like really?  </p>
<p>Q:	Are you at sort of a risk for having higher C125 because of the-</p>
<p>A:	That’s what actually the oncologist was saying that yes that she thinks that’s why, she was like “well where are you in your menstrual cycle” and she’s like “yeah I don’t think you have ovarian cancer just because the numbers are here, Dr. Young is just being overly cautious” and that is his tendency.  When he hears you have something like that he’s like “we have to do this” and I appreciate it but from what I’ve read and what I’ve learned we don’t need to run the C125.  Even when my aunt was positive with the C125 even then it wasn’t always, it was an indicator that it might be growing or spreading but it wasn’t always.  It just, so he just didn’t understand that like really you’re running a very inaccurate test on  me right now.  My better indicator which still isn’t great was the vaginal ultrasounds not the-he was like “well you have them?”  I’m like “yes I have them like every three months Dr. Young.”  </p>
<p>Q:	There’s a whole other team involved.  </p>
<p>A:	Exactly.  I really like him, he’s just a little overly zealous sometimes and stuff like that.  Because maybe if something came back so crazy with like oh maybe I need to go see the oncologist again or whatever.  </p></content>

But I want to have, we want to have a family enough that we would be willing to go through IVF if we have to.  </p></content>

   <content size="1061"><p>Q:	And so your thoughts about having kids didn’t change after you go the test results or anything like that?</p>
<p>A:	No, I still wanted to have a family.  I think what changed was the fact that I knew that having a family might have to come sooner.  I never wanted to have kids when I was in my 40s but making sure that I’m completely done and everything so we can go on and have the oophorectomy, that’s what changed is that I want to have, I know that I need to have the oophorectomy  so therefore I want to be done having our kids so that they can be a little bit older when I go in to have the surgery and we can just move on to the next stage of our lives.  So like I want to be, that was the only thing that changed, it was like well now I have like a cap to when we can have kids.  I’m like “well if they’re not now it can be another few years” where now it’s like, not that they have to but I’d like to be done by 40 so that we can go and have the oophorectomy and just move on, so we don’t have to worry about that aspect.</p></content>

It has nothing to do with okay we have to hurry up and have kids, it’s just that we both feel like we’re getting-not that we’re old but the longer we wait and if we’re going to have trouble getting pregnant, everything pushes it, that you are getting older.  So we want to be young enough that we can enjoy our kids and not feel-and we feel that 40 is like a point for us where we have to make decisions, have to do things.

<p>Q:	At that proximity.  </p>
<p>A:	Yeah.  I mean just the natural correlations, you watch the person suffer and then you watch them-when we learned about the gene, other than the end, was one of her bats with fighting the disease because it was in that first six months where she had just had surgery, she’s starting chemo, it’s  a rough six months.  And then we’re finding out that there’s this gene that could have caused her to get ovarian cancer and we’re like what?  So if I can prevent it is what you’re thinking because at that moment you’re like if the gene is what caused it and I can prevent somebody from having the gene, then yes, I would eliminate it.   </p></content>

   <content size="1808"><p>  I mean I certainly wouldn’t test embryos for sex, like that’s just messing with natural selection.  I know people would say testing for BRCA is messing with natural elements but other things I feel like maybe, if there’s something I can prevent.  Again, would that mean then there’s no embryo to implant, that’s another thing because I’ve tested everything.  </p>
<p>Q:	Then the more challenging things get in the way.  But you feel differently that gender selection would be messing with nature but the BRCA feels different. </p>
<p>A:	I think it feels different because gender selection, you get what you get, you get a girl, you get a boy.  I guess it doesn’t matter to me what I get as long as I get a healthy baby it doesn’t matter if it’s  boy or a girl.  But genetic selection to me, I guess just because having to watch somebody suffer from cancer, if I can prevent it, a boy or a girl, so what, it’s a boy or a girl, it’s not like it’s an alien, it’s a boy or a girl. [laughs]  but if I can prevent them from having cancer or some other horrific disease then maybe I would choose but just boy or a girl or if it’s to figure out the color of the eyes, that all just seems like a little too much for me. I think we should be able to just naturally have children, even with assistance but it’s starting to really mess with nature beyond testing for diseases and things like that, I don’t think I would go past, that is where the line is for me.  Just because I want a girl versus a boy, well you know that’s not something we’ve ever had a choice about.  Yes technically not implanting an embryo that’s BRCA positive is making a choice but I’m not messing with nature as much as overpopulating the world with girls because I picked only girl embryos.  </p></content>

   <content size="1497"><p>Q:	So different kind of evolutionary factors.  Did you have any reactions, I don’t know if you first heard about it here or heard about it elsewhere, the cost of PGD?</p>
<p>A:	I knew it was high.  Actually from our friends we knew it was high, each time that they went it was like $5,000 just to do the implantation.  So it wasn’t shocking.  I guess seeing it though in the number I did find it like wow, $20,000 that’s a lot.  Especially since we’re looking to buy a home right now and I’m thinking that’s part of the down payment of a house.  So definitely it does bring a little bit of like a-but at the same time those are the means people or that I’m willing to go to to have a family.  </p>
<p>Q:	So cost doesn’t influence your views about the acceptability?</p>
<p>A:	Not at this time no.</p>
<p>Q:	Do you guys have, some people have IVF and in your case it sounds like you would do it if you needed it, coverage through insurance.  </p>
<p>A:	I think it might be covered through my husband’s insurance.  I can switch my health insurance right now to cover it which I’d have to pay part of it.  I guess that’s the other reason because I know hi have an option to do that it would just cost us more a month in our health insurance.  So right now I don’t have it because it wasn’t necessary but we’ve talked about like when I-but yeah I think his might cover it. </p>

   <content size="1553"><p>Q:	Do you have any, I mean this is more the social questions, any concerns that some people would have access to it because of cost and some people wouldn’t.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah I do actually have that.  But then at the same time, if you like make it that some people have access to it and some people don’t, you also have some people who have access to get the genetic counseling and some people who don’t.  It all comes down to some people might not even know that they’re positive because they don’t have the means to find out that they’re positive.  But I think it does bother me that everything is like a-that we live in like a classist society, there’s no other way to put it.  So if you have the means you can do something and if you don’t, you can’t.  So it does bother me but I also have to take care of myself at the same time.</p>
<p>Q:	I would imagine in your line of work there’s actually a lot of having to figure that out because you could give everything and similar to my line of work as well.  </p>
<p>A:	Exactly, that’s why I sometimes just have to remind myself like I’m not my clients for example who are poor and mentally ill.   I’m me, and I went to law school and my husband’s a physician assistant and we can afford this, we can do this.  I can’t always, I feel sorry but I can’t always like not do it because the people I work with or whatever can’t.  Yes I feel bad that other people can’t afford it but if it’s something we can afford and we can do then it is something we would do.</p></content>

But I think I would still talk to him about breast exams because he still has an increased chance and would talk to him about seeing somebody and getting tested.  Maybe because I’m not as familiar with what he would need to do finding the appropriate doctor to take him to so that we could talk to them and talk to him about what he needs to do, so that he’s preventing any possible things for himself.

   <content size="5028"><p>-whenever I go to my gynecologists office I feel like they don’t know that much about BRCA in general which I always find surprising being that there has been so much, like the increase in it.  And I think maybe more gynecologists-I mean I haven’t been to a fertility specialist so I don’t know what they’re talking about but I know from my own gynecologist’s office that I feel like if I were to bring this up to them they’d be like what are you talking about?  My own doctors don’t necessarily-in some aspects I have a better education about it than my own doctors, so if there’s a way to like get the medical profession, especially doctors like gynecologists that deal specifically with women of childbearing, that if they could be made more aware of, especially that they can test the embryos, so that they can tell a patient like myself who might not have access to this that “oh, you know, I heard about this” so when you go to the fertility specialist maybe you should ask the fertility specialist and here’s an article about it or whatever.  Because I know my own doctor’s office would be like, I really feel like if I were to say something to them they’d say I don’t know what you’re talking about.  But I mean the fertility specialist might be different because they’re, obviously my gynecologist is not the one doing the implantation obviously it’s the-but at the same time if I ask them to test the embryos, the fetus they might say to me, again, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”  Well I went-and again, I don’t know if there’s a way to better educate the medical profession so that it can come down to patients.</p>
<p>Q:	So it’s not just about conversations with your oncologist, that it needs to be a broader conversation with the whole medical treatment team and don’t feel like that’s really-</p>
<p>A:	Yeah because I definitely feel like my gynecologist’s office is not always like that, when I’ve brought it to them they’re like yeah whatever, they’re just not that like up on it.  I don’t know if it’s-I see a group I don’t know if it’s the doctor I tend to see or I don’t know.  </p>
<p>Q:	So you’ve got two sides: you’ve got like your primary care physician who’s like-</p>
<p>A:	And my breast surgeon is up on it.  I do see him twice a year and he’s actually an older doctor, he’s been practicing a long time so he is up on it in that aspect.  And my mother only sees him because she’s had a few cysts that he’s had to biopsy or remove but she’s not at any risk.  But then when I met him he goes well I’ll see you once a year from now on because you’re one of my high risk patients.  And when he said, and because my mom came with me the first time and he was like “oh and it’s good to see you Joyce” because he doesn’t see her unless there’s something they found in a mammogram or something and then she goes.  And so he’s up enough that he’s like because you’re a BRCA positive I’m going to see you at least once a year and now he’s decided he wants to do the breast exam every six months.  You know what I’m saying? It was just a different, so he-</p>
<p>Q:	The fact that he made that distinction between you and your mom based on that information.</p>
<p>A:	Right and here I am 30 years younger than my mom, coming in with her and he’s like I have to see, you I’ll just see when something comes up, you I’ll see every year just to say hi.  Really, that’s really what we do.  Hopefully that’s all, but that’s usually what we see each other for.  It just shows you the distinction.  And then as I said my own gynecologist’s office though when I bring things up to them they’re like-the perfect example is when I went for just my annual exam it was about when I needed a breast exam and I said something to the gynecologist, I said “I need my breast exam because I’m BRCA positive.”  He gave me the worst breast exam I’ve ever had, literally like, I even told Mike about it.  He didn’t have me lay down, he didn’t have me put my hand over my head and I’m like this isn’t a breast exam, he felt me up.  And I told Mike and he was like-my mom happened to have gone, it was just coincidental we were at the doctor’s office the same day, she was like “he gave the worst breast exam I’ve ever had” and both of us were like he didn’t do anything. And that just shows, and again being that I like specifically said like I need you as the professional to do this and he didn’t give a professional exam, like he did a worse job than I do.  </p>
<p>Q:	Do you see somebody in the city?</p>
<p>A:	Now I might but when-I lived up in Westchester so I usually see people in Westchester.  So now I am just going to keep going to the breast surgeon because he gives a thorough exam but I just kind of felt-</p>
<p>Q:	Yeah that’s something that he didn’t know how to do.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, exactly.  Especially again, he’s that doctor.  </p></content>

   <content size="800"><p>Q:	Hopefully just repeating what you’re saying.  So have you had any experience, either personally or people you know, with assisted reproduction such as IVF?</p>
<p>A:	Yes, but not having to do with breast cancer.  My cousin, she had a </p>
<p>daughter and then she had trouble getting pregnant again so she had IVF.  And now she has twins.</p>
<p>Q:	But it wasn’t for any disease, she just couldn’t get pregnant.</p>
<p>A:	She just couldn’t get pregnant.</p>
<p>Q:	Well congratulations for them.  How are they?  Are they okay with the twins?</p>
<p>A:	They’re happy, they were premature and now they are healthier than a normal child.  </p>
<p>Q:	Wonderful.  But you said they didn’t use additional genetic testing?</p>
<p>A:	They didn’t do it to avoid, yeah, genetics.</p></content>

   <content size="576"><p>Q:	So you’ve thought about these things as they relate to your own life since you’ve learned them in school?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, exactly.  I feel like other students maybe learn it, take it as like a grain of salt, all these new technologies and things to know, where I take it as something that might come up in my future, so it’s easy for me to remember amniocentesis and Tay-Sachs and Down’s Syndrome and breast cancer genes.

   <content size="1007"><p>A:	I was told that eating right and exercising, I can not express the gene.  That’s what my gynecologist told me, and she’s very holistic.  So I don’t know if that’s right, but it sounds good and it can’t hurt me.  </p>
<p>Q:	Yeah, exactly.  It’s one of those things it never hurts to be healthy.  Is your gynecologist associated with Sloan Kettering?</p>
<p>A:	No, she’s back in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Q:	That makes sense.  And is that consistent as well with what you heard here, or did they talk about lifestyle here?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, they said exercise, eat right, take vitamins.  She was against me having implants or having mastectomy.  She was totally against that.  She was all about not expressing the gene.  She didn’t believe in surgery to prevent it or just to be safe, she didn’t believe in any of that, and Sloan Kettering was like, “You should do a prophylactic mastectomy; it’s not necessary right now but you should eventually.”  So those views were different.</p></content>

   <content size="809"><p>Q:	Do you feel like you would have wanted this mentioned at that point?</p>
<p>A:	No.  I was just more concerned about me at that point developing cancer than my children, at 19.  </p>
<p>Q:	So even if you planned to have kids young that would be a lot to take in at that point. </p>
<p>A:	Now that I’m getting older, I’m almost done with college and I’m starting to plan my life out, it’s something I would like to talk about now.  It wasn’t as important back then.  </p>
<p>Q:	Do you think it would have been good to know about it at all?</p>
<p>A:	No, because I don’t think I would have understood it at that point maybe.  I don’t remember what stage of classes I was in, but I’m in my third year of college now and I think I understand it much more that I would have back then.</p></content>

<p>A:	Do you mean people in general or people in my situation?</p>
<p>Q:	People in your situation, yeah.</p>
<p>A:	I think family support is really important.  That’s how I’m so comfortable to talk about it, because it’s been so prevalent in my family, common knowledge.  Books definitely help me, not that I read up on breast cancer, but just studying in school about amniocentesis and all these new technologies coming out, it’s just really helped me deal with situations.</p></content>

   <content size="1000"><p>A:	I think you need-what I heard from my ob/gyn, I don’t know, holistically not expressing the gene, it sounds good, but I know it’s not true in a lot of cases, because I know a lot of environmental factors go into expressing genes.  So her opinion didn’t really, I mean I took it into consideration but I know it wasn’t the only idea out there.  So I feel like you can’t just have one-sided opinions, like thank God I have access to Sloan Kettering and had their opinion and I had my gynecologist’s opinion.  Whereas I feel like some people might just listen to the gynecologist in other situations.  So I feel like you really have to know all your options.</p>
<p>Q:	It sounds like it’s good to have different perspectives, to have many people know about this.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, and she never told me that, she kind of told me that like, “Yeah you might get it, your mom got it at 27” whereas Sloan Kettering was like, “Yeah you have a risk but not before you’re 30.”</p></content>

My mom, she used to have a scar right through the center of her chest and it’s still visible, it’s purple because that’s how they used to do it when she had her first.  My aunt had it and it’s underneath the, what is that, on the abdomen, and she has one on the back.  You can’t even see it, it looks pretty normal.</p>
<p>Q:	So you’ve really seen how the technology has improved.</p>
<p>A:	How different it was.  In my mom’s second mastectomy they took tissue from her lower abdomen and fat from there and put that up there.  So she doesn’t have implants, she has just fat, her own tissue, and it looks amazing, she’s so happy.  Just that reaction of her being upset with having implants but a scar across her chest, and now with her scars underneath her chest and new skin and new tissue, she’s much happier.  I kind of feel like when I know it’s necessary I’ll be fine with that decision.</p></content>

<p>A:	Well we were having trouble conceiving so we did the IUI and the doctor had explained to us our best options given our situation were either to do not just IVF, but IVF with the PGD or to adopt.  So we started adoption proceedings.  </p>

<p>A:	No.  We had three miscarriages the old fashioned way, the IUI didn’t work so the next step was IVF and he talked to us about PGD but this was over the course of 18 months and like I said we decided not to pursue any more drugs or fertility treatments or anything that wasn’t going to end with a child so we went with adoption.

<p>Q:	Between the two of you or just for you personally did you have a sense of what was different?  Why do you think your son your made it, what do you think was different about that pregnancy?</p>
<p>A:	Um, no idea.  We had had-I think they put her on blood thinners, I think there was an issue with our blood, I forget the terms but right after she got pregnant she went on blood thinners with the third one.  The first two is one of those we have no explanation, not sure why it happened, it’s just nature, blah, blah, blah.  Third one they discovered, they did the testing on the placenta and they noticed clots.  So when we got pregnant with my son we put her on blood thinners right away and we think that helped.  I don’t think it was the problem with all three or else they would have-because we had the placenta tested each time and they didn’t notice any clots before that.  </p>
<p>Q:	Did you do the blood thinners with your four year old as well?</p>
<p>A:	Right away.  So as soon as-whether that was the issue or not right after we got pregnant with my daughter she went on blood thinners and she had to give herself shots every night.</p>
<p>Q:	With Heparin or whatever blood thinner it was?</p>
<p>A:	It wasn’t-Lupron, does that sound familiar?  Because it wasn’t Heparin, it was Lupron.  Plus she was-other stuff.</p>
<p>Q:	You had mentioned earlier that with the-you weren’t sure whether it was CVS or amnio so it was amnio but you remember having conversations about it.  So what were your conversations about whether or not to do amnio, because of her age it must have been recommended.  </p>
<p>A:	Because of her age it was certainly recommended that we do something and I think the amnio you do earlier.</p>

   <content size="1986"><p>A:	Right, right.  Knowing our thinking that sounds like decision we would have made, I’m just trying to remember exactly what because we spoke about which one would make more sense.  Is the amnio, gives you all the details that the CVS would give you?</p>
<p>Q:	I think they give you similar information.  </p>
<p>A:	I think maybe the amnio is also more complete or tested for more things. </p>
<p>Q:	With the fetus more developed it’s likely.  </p>
<p>A:	Yeah I think that’s another thing that would have factored into it, as I’m remembering this would have factored in.</p>
<p>Q:	Was the risk of miscarriage associated with the procedure an issue do you remember at the time?</p>
<p>A:	No.  We had read all the statistics but in our mind the statistics were skewed for two reasons.  One, not everyone has a baby in New York, where right or wrong we assumed we were getting better care than most people.  And two with the ultrasound you can see where the needle’s going when you do the amnio.  So we weren’t really too concerned.</p>

   <content size="738"><p>Well my mother at the time, maybe not three years ago, hers was maybe a little bit further back, maybe four or five years ago.  But she was late 60s if not 70 and it was not a very serious tumor, it wasn’t that big, it wasn’t an aggressive tumor, at her age they didn’t even give her chemo.</p>
<p>Q:	Was she into her 60s?</p>
<p>A:	Late 60s.  So she, if there is such a thing as a mild cancer like a stage zero, that’s what she had.  Again, she didn’t have chemo, I didn’t really take it as something that was all that-</p>
<p>Q:	Did she have surgeries?</p>
<p>A:	She had radiation.  And then when we-when my wife got diagnosed, that was more of something that impacted my life compared to when my mother got it.  </p></content>

<p>A:	She gets regular-she had always had a cyst in her breast that her doctor always got her checked twice a year as opposed to once a year for a mammogram.  And it had morphed from whatever it was into a tumor.  You know so, it was a shock at first, she’s still a young woman and she was strong, she is strong, it really wasn’t an option for her not to do everything possible.  </p></content>

She just didn’t-she’d get her treatments on Thursdays and then Friday, Saturday, Sunday it just got worse and worse for you know-my daughter was very young, my son just had to understand he couldn’t jump on her.  My daughter was very young at the time so it was more just letting her lie next to her and keep her with her without jumping on her because she had the tissue expanders in and that whole fun experience there.  And the nausea got worse as the chemo treatments went on but you know she dealt with it like a trooper.  I helped out more with the kids, I took them where I had to take them to give her her rest and we got some help with doing that.  What choices do you have?</p></content>

So she was diagnosed in August or September 2008.  Where my wife’s was a stage one, my sister’s was more like a stage one, stage two.

We had had-I think they put her on blood thinners, I think there was an issue with our blood, I forget the terms but right after she got pregnant she went on blood thinners with the third one.  The first two is one of those we have no explanation, not sure why it happened, it’s just nature, blah, blah, blah.  Third one they discovered, they did the testing on the placenta and they noticed clots.  So when we got pregnant with my son we put her on blood thinners right away and we think that helped.  I don’t think it was the problem with all three or else they would have-because we had the placenta tested each time and they didn’t notice any clots before that.  </p></content>

That’s certainly something we would terminate, we would choose to terminate the pregnancy.  But to be a carrier for a gene that may or may not mean anything down the line, I doubt, my initial reaction is that we probably would not have, I would have voted no.</p></content>

<p>Q:	So tell me about that.  So it was like I’m here and I’m okay or what was your thinking about that? </p>
<p>A:	Yeah, you know you always have a 50% chance of not getting anything your whole life, you know?  And plus they’re doing a lot of research in this area so eventually they’re going to find what to do to correct the mutation.  So I felt that in my child’s lifetime, that correction would be done.  And that maybe with-what’s it called?  Core blood?  Maybe something will be done with that. </p>

<p>Q:	I want to make sure I’m remembering correctly.  When you went back for that last round of IVF, did you talk about this or consider PGD?  Was it an option at that point to think about doing this?</p>
<p>A:	No it wasn’t an option.  My reserve was so low, the eggs were not-I wasn’t even going to get six to eight cells, there were probably going to be more like four and it probably wasn’t even going to work.  So you can’t really pull out one from a four cell-</p>

   <content size="1272"><p>A:	You know what happens is that you go through, especially if you’re alone, you go through IUI and IVF and you don’t have support because people, you’re doing a wonderful thing, you’re trying to create a life but when you have these downs, but with breast cancer you have people like, dozens of them.  So you’re never alone, you have constant support, there’s so many support groups but with not getting pregnant there’s a desperation type to it.  So that you’re in a desperation kind of place and you don’t have support groups.</p>
<p>Q:	And isolated on top of that.</p>
<p>A:	It’s a little isolating, yeah.  So it’s very, very difficult to maneuver, to keep going through.  Especially doing it alone and also thinking about being pregnant alone, raising a child alone.  I’ve done now, I’ve started to bring, now that I’ve had more time is like bring more support groups around me, more people who want to be part of this child’s life so that I’m not so alone in it.  Because I did feel a little more alone back then so yeah, but not as much now.  I think I’m going to have a community help me raise this child.</p>

<p>A:	Yes.  You know so like in the face of things, I can stand up to them and fight them, keep fighting and keep going and defend whatever I have to.  Or just get through things, I get through them.  It could take me a little while.  I’m not on many drugs, I have to take an anti-anxiety every so often.

I mean actually you would test for those just your own blood line, yeah that’s right.

Ones that you’re destined to die early, this is what I would say, my opinion is that I would do that if I was pregnant and test that and then be faced with a choice of what I want to do.

<p>Q:	Good, that’s always good to hear.  </p>
<p>A:	And then she brought in the doctor when I was tested positive but she did about an hour or an hour and a half of telling me about it, what the odds are, a little bit about what my chances of passing it were, that I could still do fertility stuff and then the doctor reiterated that when I was positive.  So I think it’s very helpful because that started me in looking into what do I want to do.  Like me, I’m very about information, I like having all the information so I can make all the decisions and so it was good for me in that I probably spent two to three hours in total with the genetic counselors over the couple of times and it was like I got all the info I needed.  I got everything I needed.  And then I even, you know I emailed back and forth with her for several months and so I able to get even a little more.  </p>
<p>Q:	Okay so you had some ongoing contact?</p>
<p>A:	Yes. </p>
<p>Q:	Was that helpful?  I know some people feel overwhelmed when they first get their genetic testing results.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah it was overwhelming, it’s very overwhelming.  She was wonderful and so email was good.  </p>
<p>Q:	What was it helpful about the emails specifically?</p>
<p>A:	I could tell her, I could just get out what I needed to say about what was going on for me at that moment and then she would return to something.  I usually had a particular question in there for her, she would answer it too.  So you know it was good because you don’t always want to talk but sometimes you want an answer and you just want to vent to someone who has more information than anybody on earth.

So you’re never alone, you have constant support, there’s so many support groups but with not getting pregnant there’s a desperation type to it.  So that you’re in a desperation kind of place and you don’t have support groups.</p>
<p>Q:	And isolated on top of that.</p>
<p>A:	It’s a little isolating, yeah.  So it’s very, very difficult to maneuver, to keep going through.  Especially doing it alone and also thinking about being pregnant alone, raising a child alone.  I’ve done now, I’ve started to bring, now that I’ve had more time is like bring more support groups around me, more people who want to be part of this child’s life so that I’m not so alone in it.

   <content size="796"><p>initially I was sorry that I did it because I was so devastated and scared, it was a lot.  The numbers are grim.  So 87% risk of this and 50% risk of that.  [crying] I was sorry at first that I did it but that really lasted very, that was very, very short lived.  Eventually I started to see it as a gift because we’re all ticking time bombs in one way or another and at least I know.  And there’s so much that can be done to help me.  So I’ve started to see it more as a gift.  I just turned 41 and I don’t have any kids and I would never have had egg retrieval had this not happened.  So now I have options that I didn’t have and that I wouldn’t have had had this not happened.  So I’m grateful for that.  I’m glad I did it now.  At first I wasn’t but now I’m glad.  </p></content>

   <content size="850"><p> I just had this discussion with a friend on Monday who’s having a hard time and I said when things are going well why would you step out of your box and step out of your comfort zone and push yourself and challenge yourself.  So it’s when things are bumpy that you really have an opportunity to understand a level of your own self that you would never have had the opportunity to see.  Because if you had told me a year ago that I would have given myself injections for 11 days and got up at 4:30 am to come into the city, then gone to school at 8:30 am and then had eggs, I would have thought you were out of your mind.  But I did it and I might do it again.  So who knows?  It really opened me up to the power, to possibilities that I never thought existed.  So in a way, believe me, I would have given anything for it to be negative.  </p></content>

   <content size="539"><p>That’s why I did the first egg retrieval cycle in the fall because I was just turning 41 and I wasn’t sure.  As it turns out despite the fact that they could kill me my ovaries were very productive and healthy and robust.  And when I first met Dr. Griffo and he did the blood work he was surprised at my age.  When he looked at the blood work first and then at my age he was surprised.  So that was my first priority was the eggs, hopefully I’ll do it again in March and I’ll hopefully I’ll have the oophorectomy in July. </p></content>

   <content size="4703"><p>Like I said I misunderstood and I thought-Dr. Offit was so cute from a geneticist perspective someone who doesn’t have children who’s BRCA positive-because he said to me “you can change your family’s destiny.”  He was basically bouncing in his seat and I thought wow, that’s tremendous to me.  But I really thought it was the eggs.  If it were the eggs I would have no trouble screening them.  And thinking-Because obviously now it’s been forced especially now that I have eggs frozen on First Avenue waiting for me-I’ve thought about it a lot and I don’t think I would do the PGD because, believe me this sucks-would I say my life hasn’t been worth living because of it?  No.  Would my mother say “I wish I never had kids?”  No.  So I think it’s a 50/50 shot and I’m hopeful that by the time my kids are grown, if I have kids, that they’ll be, that this will be a moot point, that it will be ancient history.  So diagnosis, treatment, whatever, a vaccine, so I don’t know.  And as far as the difference between my mother’s experience and mine, she was in the hospital for five days when she had her biopsy and she had a huge scar.  I have a tiny little pinhole and I was at lunch three hours later.  </p>
<p>Q:	So you’ve seen the technology.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah and I think in 25 or 30 years when my kids are facing this, God only knows, you know?  So like I said, this does suck but I would never say I wish I hadn’t been born because I have that.  You know what I’m saying?  Nor would my mother ever day I’m sorry I had kids because I passed this on.  Given the opportunity I would love to take this out of my family’s history, or not history but future.  And it’s amazing to me that I have the power to do that but I just don’t know if I could.  I mean I am Catholic but I’m not really a practicing Catholic.  I just don’t-it’s more of a personal feeling.  I just don’t know that I could discard an embryo.</p>
<p>Q:	I was going to ask, so you mentioned if it was an egg it would be a different thing.</p>
<p>A:	Because to me that’s a cell, that’s like a hair cell or a skin cell.  It’s no different than any other piece of our body but a fertilized egg, I think it’s another story.  And especially for someone who’s 41 and has no kids, who knows what my opportunities are, I couldn’t throw one away.  I just don’t think-like I said, I never thought I would be here so who knows where I would be in another year or two.  But today I just don’t see that being an option for me.</p>
<p>Q:	What was that like for you when Dr. Offit was so excited?</p>
<p>A:	Bouncing up and down?  [laughs] I really thought “wow, like this is tremendous” like I was so grateful, I was so grateful that they could help me, that they referred me to Dr. Griffo, that there was hope, that I could still have a family.</p>
<p>Q:	Would you have gone anyway to Dr. Griffo?</p>
<p>A:	Probably not if I hadn’t been, it wouldn’t have occurred to me probably.  It probably wouldn’t have.  And it just, I’m so grateful, I don’t know maybe I’ll never use them but I have the choice and that’s what Dr. Kauff said to me the first time I met him was he said, “It’s your most basic human instincts, reproduction and survival and you don’t have to choose just because you’re  BRCA positive.”  So that was tremendous.  I’m very grateful, I really am.  And I was very lucky my insurance paid for it because my ovaries have to be removed, it’s medically necessary because it was $14,000, it’s a lot of money.  </p>
<p>Q:	That is.  People ask us that question a lot, like “Oh is this covered by insurance?”  Maybe, sometimes.</p>
<p>A:	I’m very fortunate, I happen to have great insurance as a state employee and they covered.  That’s one of my hesitations for doing it again, I don’t know if they would cover it again, I have to see.  I will wait until after the biopsy.  So I was very encouraged by the staff at the counseling center and thinking about the possibilities.  </p>
<p>Q:	Did you find out in that same session that it wasn’t the eggs it was the embryo?</p>
<p>A:	No.  It was when I met with Dr. Griffo which was a few weeks later, maybe a month later.</p>
<p>Q:	Did that feel like a disappointment?</p>
<p>A:	Um, yeah I was disappointed.  It didn’t deter me.  I still did the process and I’m thinking about doing it again.  So that would be ideal if that were the case.  But then again I don’t know if I could do it more than twice and I if had to discard half my eggs because they were affected I don’t think how many times I could do it, how many times I could have the procedure.  </p></content>

   <content size="719"><p>A:	I did think about that, I thought about maybe if I did it again I would do a sperm donor for the second round because I know that embryos freeze better.  And then I guess, that just, I don’t know, I still might.  I still might, I have to talk to Dr. Griffo about it in January, which is Friday.  It’s a possibility.  I might not ever use those.  If I meet somebody and I wind up with someone I would certainly want his sperm.  But it’s a possibility because I feel like if I’ve gone this far and I only have a 60% chance with an egg I’d rather have a 90% chance with an embryo.  So that’s a lot.  I don’t know if I’m ready for that yet. </p>

  <q name="A: You know, it wasn’t as bad .." id="q32_10" au="GUEST" cDate="2010-05-06T16:49:13" mDate="2010-05-06T16:49:13" loc="1 @ 159, 787 @ 165!">
   <content size="2937"><p>A:	You know, it wasn’t as bad as I thought.  I really thought the hardest part would be the injections and schlepping into the city every morning, I’m not a morning person so getting up at 4:30 am I really didn’t think would be ideal.  But it wasn’t nearly as bad as I thought.  My first friend ever who I’ve known since I was nine months old is a doctor so she was with me the first night I did the shots and made sure I did everything right.  It just was, it was a lot easier than I expected it to be I think because I really wanted it.  She helped me, there’s one shot that you have to have 35 hours before the retrieval but it’s intramuscular and you have to give it to yourself in the butt so she did that for me so I had a lot of support that way.  And driving into the city, you know what it’s  on 38th and First, it’s right out of the Tunnel so it wasn’t bad.</p>
<p>Q:	Not much traffic at 4:30 am.</p>
<p>A:	No, it really wasn’t bad at all and most of the time I got there, I was the first one there and I was able to get to school, my principal was very forgiving, school starts at 8:30 am and I think the latest  I ever got to school was 8:45 am.  So it wasn’t terrible, it was a lot better than I anticipated.  At no point during the-I had my reservations beforehand when I went to the orientation because I was scared to death, I’d never given myself injections and I didn’t know if I could do it.  And I just said I’m going to try, kind of like what I said to you at the beginning of the session, we’ll see how it goes, I’ll take it as far as I can.  And then it became easier.  I had a harder time recovering from the surgery actually.  They tend to downplay it, there’s really no such thing as minor surgery I’ve decided.  And I had a much harder time with that than I expected.  So that was the one thing I don’t look forward to again but it wasn’t bad. </p>
<p>Q:	And the surgery, you just go through, you just went through the one time?</p>
<p>A:	Right, just once.  </p>
<p>Q:	But it’s sort of, even in our presentation it’s probably minimized.  </p>
<p>A:	Well they said some people go back to work that day and I was like really?  Because I needed like three days.  I don’t respond well to anesthesia, whatever, I don’t know what it was but I just was like, I was bloated, I was in so much pain and I thought “Wow, it’s really not that simple.”  But whatever, that was the one drawback.  I also was at the top of, the doctor’s at the top of his game, I mean Dr. Griffo’s the guy so I knew I was in good hands.  Kind of like how I feel about being here at Sloan I trusted him completely.  He’s like a rock star, when he walks in the room I don’t know what to do with myself.  He makes people for a living, how cool is that?  I really, I found it to be, they made it as easy as possible for me.  And like again I said I had a lot of support.</p></content>

   <content size="1992"><p>A:	Well I have to-I mean my concerns about that would be the same as my concerns about the egg retrieval.  Being BRCA positive I know that, when I spoke to my doctor about it, Dr. Robson he was concerned, not concerned, he said it’s a risk to take the hormones with my condition or whatever you want to call it.  Yeah I think it’s risky and I think it’s experimental, the procedure’s experimental, it’s an experimental science, even freezing the eggs and thawing the eggs or the embryos is still experimental really.  Yeah I definitely-</p>
<p>Q:	So you have, you sort of it sounds like you thought at least about “how will this affect my risk?”</p>
<p>A:	Oh absolutely.  This is what I decided, and I could be completely deluding myself, but if I smoked for 11 days over the course of my lifetime I probably wouldn’t develop lung cancer so if I take hormones for 11 days over the course of my life I probably won’t develop breast cancer from it. </p>
<p>Q:	You felt it was short lived and that was okay?</p>
<p>A: 	Yeah that’s what I decided because I never took-because I knew about my breast cancer risk I never took the pill or anything like that so I’ve never taken hormones before so I was comfortable in doing it for that brief period of time.  But I did think about it, yeah.</p>
<p>Q:	Did you feel okay about the information you got about it?</p>
<p>A:	I asked a lot of doctors and everybody seemed to think-I mean Dr. Robson was concerned but it’s his job to be concerned, but most, the general feeling was it’s such a short period of time and it’s a low dose that it’s not, would they recommend me doing it monthly?  One doctor actually said to me, it’s nothing compared to the risk of taking the pill every month and knowing that I’ve never done that it made me feel a little bit more secure about it.  So no, I asked around but I was, I know it’s a risk but you know what, the last six months have taught me everything’s a risk.</p></content>

   <content size="788"><p>Q:	Any close friends?</p>
<p>A:	Yes.  I have a very good friend who has Crone’s disease and when she was pregnant she was pretty determined to have the baby no matter what was wrong but she was on a lot of medication throughout her pregnancy to sustain the pregnancy.  And she really didn’t eat through her pregnancy so she was on liquid nutrition the whole time so there were definite risks, but she was determined to have the baby.  I have a lot of friends who just never had amniocentesis, never had the testing because they decided that it was what it was, that’s their baby, that’s going to be the way it is.  So my experience has been I guess more conservative because more people have opted not to be tested or despite the testing to forge ahead with the pregnancy.</p></content>

<p>A:	Well I don’t have children so it’s definitely something I have to think about.  I do have my 13 eggs waiting for me.  I don’t really think either one would be for me.  When I first, when I met with Dr. Offit and Sherry in the counseling center, I misunderstood and I thought the eggs could be screened for mutation.  If that were a possibility I think I would certainly do it but an embryo’s a different, I think an embryo’s a different story.  So I don’t think, an embryo certainly, if I couldn’t screen an embryo I don’t think I could do that with a fetus either.  So I don’t think either one would be-</p>

Like I think people who already have kids or someone who’s pregnant might think-I don’t know, that’s a tough decision to make.  So I don’t know.

<p>A:	I don’t know.  Maybe.  My big concern would be financial because I would have to work and to me having a baby just to have a baby and having someone else take care of it would be selfish.  I would rather have a baby as a product of a partnership, you know?  But who knows.  </p>
<p>Q:	So you haven’t gone that next step of considering sperm donors?</p>
<p>A:	I did think about that, I thought about maybe if I did it again I would do a sperm donor for the second round because I know that embryos freeze better.  And then I guess, that just, I don’t know, I still might.  I still might, I have to talk to Dr. Griffo about it in January, which is Friday.  It’s a possibility.  I might not ever use those.  If I meet somebody and I wind up with someone I would certainly want his sperm.  But it’s a possibility because I feel like if I’ve gone this far and I only have a 60% chance with an egg I’d rather have a 90% chance with an embryo.  So that’s a lot.  I don’t know if I’m ready for that yet. </p>
<p>Q:	That would be a whole other set of concerns.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah it’s a lot to think about, what characteristics and features and I don’t know. </p>
<p>Q:	I was going to ask if you’re seeing anybody now?</p>
<p>A:	Not really anybody.  I recently met somebody but who knows?  I take things very slowly, crash and burn.  [laughs] So, no nothing, nobody who’s egg worthy yet, I don’t think.  But who knows, things change.  It could change overnight.</p></content>

<p>A:	I would imagine so.  I don’t think it would be as hard, I don’t know, but I don’t think it would be as hard for me because my brother is disabled and I can’t imagine my life without him.  So I don’t know that I could abort a baby because it had Down’s Syndrome.

There are definitely things that I’d have to be tested for but I don’t know that I would do anything, especially in the position that I’m in, knowing how valuable those little eggs are and how hard they are to come by.

So I called my superintendent to tell him and he was just, he was angelic about it, he still is.  He checks on me all the time.

She helped me, there’s one shot that you have to have 35 hours before the retrieval but it’s intramuscular and you have to give it to yourself in the butt so she did that for me so I had a lot of support that way.

And then I guess, that just, I don’t know, I still might.  I still might, I have to talk to Dr. Griffo about it in January, which is Friday.  It’s a possibility.  I might not ever use those.  If I meet somebody and I wind up with someone I would certainly want his sperm.  But it’s a possibility because I feel like if I’ve gone this far and I only have a 60% chance with an egg I’d rather have a 90% chance with an embryo.  So that’s a lot.  I don’t know if I’m ready for that yet. </p></content>

Again I have great insurance and even though Sloan is private I have something called, my insurance company has something called cancer resources system which puts Sloan in network so everything is covered.  I’m very grateful for that.  But I worry about, I only have so many sick days and I’m afraid if I lose my sick days obviously I won’t get paid, I won’t get benefits anymore if I’m not an employee of the district anymore.  So I worry about money and plus it just, the surgery that I had in February the doctor wasn’t on my plan and it cost me thousands of dollars.  So things come up with your BRCA positive that I just have to have a little bit of a cushion.  So if insurance doesn’t pay for it again I don’t know that I would do it again.  I could always take out a loan or something like that.  I don’t know, I would have to think about it. </p></content>

<p>A:	Yeah, sure.  </p>

It should be available to people just as human beings, not as stock brokers or whatever.  I think even more so for people who are lower socio-economic status because if they have children with disabilities they might not have the means to support them or get them what they need.

So she was tested first and she wasn’t positive then I wouldn’t need to be.  So I went with that but that didn’t work out.  But no, I think initially it was very overwhelming and very scary.  I deliberately scheduled a vacation for the two weeks that I was waiting for the results because I knew I couldn’t just sit home and wait.  So that was a big help.  And then, initially I was sorry that I did it because I was so devastated and scared, it was a lot.  The numbers are grim.  So 87% risk of this and 50% risk of that.  [crying] I was sorry at first that I did it but that really lasted very, that was very, very short lived.  Eventually I started to see it as a gift because we’re all ticking time bombs in one way or another and at least I know.  And there’s so much that can be done to help me.  So I’ve started to see it more as a gift.  I just turned 41 and I don’t have any kids and I would never have had egg retrieval had this not happened.  So now I have options that I didn’t have and that I wouldn’t have had had this not happened.  So I’m grateful for that.  I’m glad I did it now.  At first I wasn’t but now I’m glad.

And my father said “you know he’s trying to scare you?”  And I said “Daddy, do you think I’m afraid of him with everything else I have going on?”  So it’s helped me build a lot of confidence and helped me prioritize things.

<p>A:	I don’t think so.  I don’t think I’d want to know because I wouldn’t want to have it affect my parenting.  I wouldn’t want the child to always be afraid or like I said, I don’t know if I mentioned this but this sucks and it’s really an adult thing, it’s not something for a child to have to deal with.

<p>A:	No.  He has a very high anxiety level and there’s really no reason for him to know.</p>
<p>Q:	Well if he ends up testing-</p>
<p>A:	I don’t know if he, I don’t even know if he tested positive if he would even know about it.  Because his family obviously and the people and the agency that care for him, it would be documented in his records and they would make sure, even when we’re not here anymore in 100 years that he would be checked routinely.  I don’t know that he would ever have to know because like I said he has blood tests routinely for other things.  It would just be-or he goes to the doctors like everybody else does and you have to have a prostate exam anyway after a certain age men have to have a prostate exam.  So I think he would just-it would just be a matter of course.  </p></content>

But I’m not comfortable waiting that long so I really would like to have them removed this summer.  That’s why I did the first egg retrieval cycle in the fall because I was just turning 41 and I wasn’t sure.  As it turns out despite the fact that they could kill me my ovaries were very productive and healthy and robust.  And when I first met Dr. Griffo and he did the blood work he was surprised at my age.  When he looked at the blood work first and then at my age he was surprised.  So that was my first priority was the eggs, hopefully I’ll do it again in March and I’ll hopefully I’ll have the oophorectomy in July.  I couldn’t possibly do it sooner.  I have a tough class, I love them but I have 25 kids, 17 boys and they’re crazy and I think if I went through surgical menopause during the school year I would kill somebody or myself.  So I think waiting until the summer would be, yeah-if I can wait safely then I don’t really see why I would put myself or them through that.  So I need to wait a little bit.  </p></content>

We found out right at the beginning of the school year- she’s also a teacher- and at first, she had a double mastectomy and it just seemed to barbaric to me.  It is barbaric I think.  At first, when this first happened I started to think, why would I do that to myself unless I absolutely had to?  But over the last three months with the chemo and everything else she’s had to endure, if I could do something to spare myself that, I think it would be foolish not to, but I’m not ready. </p></content>

So I went with that but that didn’t work out.  But no, I think initially it was very overwhelming and very scary.  I deliberately scheduled a vacation for the two weeks that I was waiting for the results because I knew I couldn’t just sit home and wait.  So that was a big help.  And then, initially I was sorry that I did it because I was so devastated and scared, it was a lot.  The numbers are grim.  So 87% risk of this and 50% risk of that.  [crying] I was sorry at first that I did it but that really lasted very, that was very, very short lived.  Eventually I started to see it as a gift because we’re all ticking time bombs in one way or another and at least I know.  And there’s so much that can be done to help me.  So I’ve started to see it more as a gift.  I just turned 41 and I don’t have any kids and I would never have had egg retrieval had this not happened.

<p>Q:	Would you have gone anyway to Dr. Griffo?</p>
<p>A:	Probably not if I hadn’t been, it wouldn’t have occurred to me probably.  It probably wouldn’t have.  And it just, I’m so grateful, I don’t know maybe I’ll never use them but I have the choice and that’s what Dr. Kauff said to me the first time I met him was he said, “It’s your most basic human instincts, reproduction and survival and you don’t have to choose just because you’re  BRCA positive.”  So that was tremendous.

   <content size="1189"><p>Q:	I asked you a related question but I guess, did learning about your BRCA status, did that change how you thought about whether or not to have kids at all or did that play into-</p>
<p>A:	Um, yeah it did.  Before I got tested, that was one of the things that I thought about is if I have this do I want to pass this on.  I’m sorry, not before I got tested, before I did the egg retrieval, when I was deciding to do that, which was a lot easier than I would have thought the decision to do that.  I did think about that, do I want to perpetuate this?  And I guess I said before that having a baby on your own would be selfish but maybe what I, but people might think what I did was selfish, too, I don’t know.  But it was the right decision for me.  But like I said, I just can’t imagine-being BRCA positive I don’t think would affect my decision to have a baby, I really don’t.  So this is just such a, you wouldn’t know based on the discussion that we’re having and the way you know me but, it’s such a small piece of who I am.  It doesn’t define me as a person.  At least I try not to.  On a day like this maybe [cyring] it does but in general it doesn’t.  </p></content>

   <content size="1922"><p>A:	You know, it wasn’t as bad as I thought.  I really thought the hardest part would be the injections and schlepping into the city every morning, I’m not a morning person so getting up at 4:30 am I really didn’t think would be ideal.  But it wasn’t nearly as bad as I thought.  My first friend ever who I’ve known since I was nine months old is a doctor so she was with me the first night I did the shots and made sure I did everything right.  It just was, it was a lot easier than I expected it to be I think because I really wanted it.  She helped me, there’s one shot that you have to have 35 hours before the retrieval but it’s intramuscular and you have to give it to yourself in the butt so she did that for me so I had a lot of support that way.  And driving into the city, you know what it’s  on 38th and First, it’s right out of the Tunnel so it wasn’t bad.</p>
<p>Q:	Not much traffic at 4:30 am.</p>
<p>A:	No, it really wasn’t bad at all and most of the time I got there, I was the first one there and I was able to get to school, my principal was very forgiving, school starts at 8:30 am and I think the latest  I ever got to school was 8:45 am.  So it wasn’t terrible, it was a lot better than I anticipated.  At no point during the-I had my reservations beforehand when I went to the orientation because I was scared to death, I’d never given myself injections and I didn’t know if I could do it.  And I just said I’m going to try, kind of like what I said to you at the beginning of the session, we’ll see how it goes, I’ll take it as far as I can.  And then it became easier.  I had a harder time recovering from the surgery actually.  They tend to downplay it, there’s really no such thing as minor surgery I’ve decided.  And I had a much harder time with that than I expected.  So that was the one thing I don’t look forward to again but it wasn’t bad. </p></content>

And she really didn’t eat through her pregnancy so she was on liquid nutrition the whole time so there were definite risks, but she was determined to have the baby.  I have a lot of friends who just never had amniocentesis, never had the testing because they decided that it was what it was, that’s their baby, that’s going to be the way it is.  So my experience has been I guess more conservative because more people have opted not to be tested or despite the testing to forge ahead with the pregnancy.</p></content>

It might be helpful for them to be able to disseminate that information like you know it might be difficult to hear but there’s hope and there are choices that even if you are positive that you can do x, y and z.

   <content size="1848"><p>What was your reaction to the cost of PGD? What’s your sense?</p>
<p>A: Ridiculously expensive.  I asked the first specialist, does insurance cover it.</p>
<p>Q: Yeah. </p>
<p>A: And it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Q: No. </p>
<p>A: Which I don’t really-at what point does it cover for anything-I mean, does it cover? </p>
<p>Q: There are state by state laws about whether insurance companies are required to cover in vitro fertilization procedures if a couple has documented infertility but the PGD would be over and above that if an insurance company did pick up those costs. </p>
<p>A: Right. </p>
<p>Q: There are other parts of the world where the government-where you could apply to the government for this procedure and they’ll cover it or where insurance will cover it, but here it’s not yet regulated at all. So it’s all out of pocket. </p>
<p>A: Right.</p>
<p>Q: Which presents some other ethical questions. </p>
<p>A: But then the question is-do you do it once? Do you do it twice? And then it doesn’t work, do you stop doing it and then you are like ok, you know, or is it like you are in bed with it and then you do it 8 times? You know what I mean. </p>
<p>Q: Well it’s a personal choice.</p>
<p>A: Right. But then it’s like did we really just wasted money? </p>
<p>Q: Is it-is it how many cycles is it worth and at what point do you give up and say, we’ll just kiss that money goodbye. </p>
<p>A: Yeah.</p>
<p>Q: We’re not, yeah. Well that’s a good question.</p>
<p>A: Right.</p>
<p>Q: So. </p>
<p>A: I mean I think, you know, that was one of her negatives also. It’s ridiculously expensive. Like you know, not that we couldn’t spend the money, you know, I mean technically we could afford it.

You know but obviously canceling a pregnancy is a lot tougher to make when it’s actually happening in person, then in theory it sounds like a great idea. So, you just do it again. I guess it would also depend, I think it would be easier you know if it was your second kid and you realize you got pregnant quick both times and you thought alright we could cancel this and do it again, shouldn’t be a problem.

He was in our house when he got sick, and he lived with us when-he was in our house when he died, and I was in high school I think.  So I saw it, but again, he always had issues that really transcended his mental retardation.  He had some of the same sort of battery of physical problems that sometimes you see in someone who’s also mentally retarded.  I’m not sure if there was some connection between the two-</p>
